        <description>I picked up The Creative Act because it is Rick Rubin. I was intrigued because it isn&amp;rsquo;t a memoir of his career in the music industry. The Creative Act is Rick&amp;rsquo;s take on the act of creativity. It is his advice and approach to the creative flow. With such a heady concept I figured I could find inspiration in it and apply it to my life.
Rick Rubin is a music icon.</description>

        <description>I recently read Shape Up based on the recommendation of peers at work looking to iterate on their product development life cycle. Like many companies we follow scrum loosely. Scrum works well once an initiative moves into delivery but we struggle with the upfront discovery, definition, and design phases. Historically we have done annual planning, spending countless months to create outcomes, debate initiatives, and adjust the organizational structure only to realize 2 months in to the new year we need to pivot.</description>
