        <description>I picked up The Creative Act because it is Rick Rubin. I was intrigued because it isn&amp;rsquo;t a memoir of his career in the music industry. The Creative Act is Rick&amp;rsquo;s take on the act of creativity. It is his advice and approach to the creative flow. With such a heady concept I figured I could find inspiration in it and apply it to my life.
Rick Rubin is a music icon.</description>
