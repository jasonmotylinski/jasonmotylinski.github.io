              Courtney and I made it back from Europe in one piece. It was a whirlwind tour which took us to the likes of Malta, Rome, and Flourence. It was fabulous and I guarantee we'll be going back as soon as we can. The Maltese people are some of the kindest, nicest people you'll ever meet. And Italy is more amazing in person than it is in the books. I'm sure over the next few weeks I'll post some of the stories from the trip. There are just too many, I don't know where to begin. So for now enjoy the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030124175436/http://www.computerjargon.com/gallery/album27">photo gallery</a> from our trip.<br>

              Courtney and I were supposed to be jetsetting today to Italy but our plans were delayed a day by a destroyed passport. Our dogs decided to go apeshit and eat Courtney's passport. Thank god I work for a travel/event planning agency. At one point the plan was to fly Courtney to Chicago to get a rush passport. Instead we opted for the easier and cheaper method of having someone else do the dirty footwork and just send us the passport after it's all done. But that meant we had to fly out on Friday instead of Thursday. We'll miss one day in Malta but at least we can still go. Our dogs have been severely scolded.<br>

              The worst color of shirt to own if you have to get dressed in the dark is red. I only only 2 red t-shirts but they are always on the top of the pile in my dresser. Every morning (ok, every OTHER morning) I grab for a clean t-shirt and by chance I always get a fist full of red. <br>

              Over lunch I ran to Texaco to run my car through the car wash. I waited in line behind an SUV. The SUV entered their code and proceeded to drive into the wash. But she drove too far and drove over the wheel sensor. The wash started beeping constantly and signs started flashing that she should back up. Instead, she drove forward and out of the wash. So there I am, code in hand, with her wash incomplete and lights flashing for the non-existant car to back up. What did I do? I did what any cold-blooded american would have. I drove into the bay and stole her wash.<br>

I'm hoping everyone had a good Christmas. Mine was fairly typical. Get sick, visit the relatives and such. I made a voyage to Madison to watch my brother graduate. I was surprised by the sprawling Madison campus. It was HUGE. I don't know how any of those students get around without a car or bus ride.<br><br>
I support it's time for my annual gift rundown. So here it goes:<br>
The wireless Logitech elite duo keyboard/mouse - A hot gift and ironically the same thing I had gotten my dad for christmas.<br>
A cashmere scarf and a piece of artwork from my wonderful wife.<br>
A toolbelt, bar clamps, and saw horse brackets from the Motylinski side of the family. I never thought I would be so happy to get such useful items. Although the 2x4s for the saw horses were not wrapped.<br><br>

              Screw November. Nothing really happened anyway. Thanksgiving was fine. Work has been stressful. Layoffs and re-orgs has made work a little less tolerable than it was prior. Our billable hours are now watched like hawks. It's the third company in a row where this has happened so it's not much of a surprise, I suppose. <br><br>
On the computer front I picked up an Epson C82 photo printer which I absolutely love. It actually prints photo quality pictures without using a tank of ink. I also made the mistake of buying an ATI graphics card for my video games. blah. But if you haven't experienced the raw violence of Grand Theft Auto 3 I suggest you try it. There's nothing like being a completely ruthless vigilante with a bat and then running an ambulance route.<br><br>
Courtney and I are going to Malta and Rome in January. As a perk of my job I won an all-expense paid trip to Europe for a week. It should be righteous. Although I'm already uptight about flying. <br>
