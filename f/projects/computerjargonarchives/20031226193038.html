They have created a robot, the Qrio, which can run up to 14 meters per minute. Don't be fooled by the photos, the robot is only 23-inches high. The robot actually has both feet off the ground for a fraction of a second while running, a major accomplishment for robot makers. It can even hold a fan while it dances. Now if only I could program it to get me a specific type of beer out of my fridge and to walk my dogs.<br>

        In an attempt to avoid boredem last night, Courtney and I ventured into downtown for some nightlife. Specifically, we were in search of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031226193038/http://www.gameworks.com/">Gameworks</a>. Their motto: Eat. Drink. Play. Party. I was hoping it would be what I had hoped Chuck E. Cheese would be for my birthday. For the most part it was. I was surprised to see so many kids running around. Gameworks has a very adult feel to it. Right in the middle of the gamefloor is a medium-sized bar. Even so, Gameworks kicked the kids out at 9pm. Court and I had a blast. We spent most of our time and money playing Derby Racing. As you can imagine a video game about horses was right up Court's alley. It was like gambling in Vegas without the chance of ever winning anything. It was a hoot having to train your horse, feed it the right thing, and properly whip/hold it while racing. Court did take me to town in Air Hockey. I underestimated her hand-eye coordination.<br>

			<td bgcolor="#ffffff" class="ContentFormat">
				<span class="Date">Posted on 2003-12-11 06:02:08</span><br><br>
        I signed up with NetFlix earlier this week. A handful of co-workers have told me how great the service is. I couldn't keep myself from feeling like I, too, had to participate in the evolution. After a minor glitch with registration, I was in and ready to start NetFlixing.<br><br>
NetFlix's gig is to send you movies in the mail. You create a queue of movies. They send you 3 movies at a time from your queue, based on the priority you give the movies. You can then keep the movies for as long as you like. Once done, you toss them in the mail and you'll receive more movies automatically. There's no need to go to the store and pick out another film. You've got a queue so they just continue to send them to you. <br><br>
The addiction started right away. I haven't even received a single movie yet but I can't stop surfing around on their website. Morning, lunch, evening, I'm on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031226193038/http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix.com</a> I'm adding movies to my queue, ranking movies in search of that one elusive, perfect movie I have forgotten about. It becomes a game much like the Chris Farley celebrity interviews on SNL. "Do they have this movie?! Yeah, that's a good one. Oooh! Do they have that one? Yeah, I liked that movie too." I just can't stop.<br><br>
The size and quality of your movie queue becomes interesting water cooler talk. "I heard a fable about one guy who has 284 movies in his queue!" Other NetFlixers want to know what you're watching so they can size up your tastes. What does it say about me when the first 3 films I've rented are Old School, Anger Management, and Clockwork Orange?<br>
