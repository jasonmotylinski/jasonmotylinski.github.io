								<b>2001-07-19 18:38:10 - Outage is a mixed blessing</b>
				<hr size="2" noshade>
				It turns out that my power outage has been a mixed blessing. If you haven't heard there's a worm on the loose which is tormenting Microsoft IIS servers across the net. It's duty, install itself into IIS, spread itself to other IIS servers, and wait for July 20th GMT to attack DOS style on whitehouse.gov. At work our servers were hit causing our firewalls to literally melt under the DOS traffic. Word on the street Cisco 675 routers melt under the pressure too. So my Cisco was off all day long. I missed much of the traffic. Then I read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010720131316/http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=01/07/19/2230246&amp;cid=25">this comment</a> on Slashdot about weird requests in Apache logs. Sure enough, I've had a TON of them. So score one for Linux, Apache, and open source. Since I had my router forwarding port 80 to the server that took most of the DOS requests away from the router and sent it to the Linux box. My Linux box has just sat there grinning and barring it. <br>

				<hr size="2" noshade>
				I really, really hate Xcel Energy. My power has been out for 15 of 18 hours today. argh. Good thing I just paid a very hefty electric bill. Maybe now they can afford to keep my lights on.<br>

				<hr size="2" noshade>
				I must say, I had a pretty good weekend. Nothing shocking or mind blowing happened. But I did have a little of everything which added a nice sugar and spice coating to life. I picked up <b>You are being lied to</b> and <b>Neuromancer</b> at B&N; this weekend. I also happened upon the new <b>Gorillaz</b> disc which is quite good. I would suggest looking for their song <b>Clint Eastwood</b>. It's a fun track. <br><br>
I woke up at roughly 2am to find my power had gone out again. I guess paying nearing 900 bucks in rent still isn't enough to keep the lights on. In my dazed stupor I did manage to reset my clock but I failed to realize that it was Monday morning and I did not set the alarm. Thank god I work better than an atomic clock. I snapped awake at 5:30am and promptly questioned what the hell was going on. When I realized my mistake I took care of the near-fatal accident.<br><br>
Courtney and I also picked out my wedding band this weekend. I must admit, I haven't been this excited about something in awhile. Get this - My ring is made of Titanium! The jeweler said if I were in a fire, my ring would come out unscathed. It's tougher and stronger than platinum. I was hoping to set up a demonstration at the wedding of me breaking stuff with my knuckle. Courtney said we should probably save that for another day.<br>

				<hr size="2" noshade>
				In an attempt to jumpstart my morning I've sucked down a Pepsi and am half way through a cup of coffee with another on the horizon.<br><br>
BTW - Don't shop at K-Mart anymore. And I know most of you will say that K-Mart is shit and you don't shop there anyway. But I mean stop all commerce with them. Don't stop in there for something to drink, batteries, or a birthday card. Stop all transactions with them. They are truly a disgusting corporation. Now I have the enemy in my sights. I will hone the crosshairs and take aim.<br>

				<hr size="2" noshade>
				Jesus, I look like ass today. I can't believe I made it out of the apartment looking like this. Courtney should have said something.<br><br>
Last night DJ Spree and I hit the Artist's Quarter for some booze and bad love poetry. It actually turned out to be a fairly eventful night. The first performer we saw was a horrid middle-class white male comedian. And I tell you that because that was his act. He got up there and announced that he was white and "SORRY!" I honestly didn't know it was supposed to be funny because he looked like he was one Titanic-ending from crying. But as he settled down I got the picture that this was a fledgling comedy routine. Luckily for our sake there wasn't much bad love poetry. On a whole, that's how I would characterize the Artist's Quarter on Wednesday nights. Filled with teenagers who write bad love poetry.  <br>
