						<center><b>Welcome to Computer Jargon!</b></center><br>
						<b>2000-04-21 - One Bad Day</b><br>Actually, let me rephrase that. "One Bad Week" I have not had one thing go right this week. I should have known this after Monday when I got a stern talking to regarding the lateness of a project. From then on it just got worse. It got so bad that today I actually thought I was going to throw something across the room. I was so angry at poor workflow and shitass work that I could find no better solution than throwing something. Luckily I grabbed a stress ball and cooled out a little. But I'm still mad as hell about workflow.<br><br>
New? You want something new? You want something more than just me bitching every day? You don't enjoy this? You don't find me amusing? You don't understand where I'm coming from? <br><br>
Imagine getting to the top of a hill. Then imagine that someone forgot to tell you that you had to go 10 more feet up. And then when you get there, you have to go 10 more. It's neverending. You'll never reach the top..<br>[<a href="comment.php?writecomment=1&amp;jid=26">Post a comment</a>]<br><br><div class="comments"><ul><li><b><a href="comment.php?cid=25">Who taught you how to...</a></b> by Anonymous<ul></ul><li><b><a href="comment.php?cid=24">cx</a></b> by Anonymous<ul></ul><li><b><a href="comment.php?cid=23">cx</a></b> by Anonymous<ul></ul><li><b><a href="comment.php?cid=22">Jerk</a></b> by jason<ul></ul></ul></div><b>2000-04-07 - Lord of the....</b><br>Broken Industries was upgraded to RedHat 6.2 last night. It was less painless then the upgrade to RedHat 6.1. Maybe I knew what to expect this time. Anyway, it appears that DNS, HTTPD, and SMB are all working. They have been the thorn in my side. I need to figure out how the hell to get them to boot at startup. Somehow HTTPD has stopped booting at bootup. It's very annoying. I think I'll have to place a call into 1-800-BOJAY.<br><br>
A new X-Men trailer is out. I'm very excited for this summer's movie releases. There are going to be some really kickass geek movies coming out. Gladiator, Titan AE, X-Men. The list goes on and on. <br>[<a href="comment.php?writecomment=1&amp;jid=25">Post a comment</a>]<br><br><div class="comments"><ul><li><b><a href="comment.php?cid=26">Drinking again...</a></b> by Anonymous<ul></ul><li><b><a href="comment.php?cid=21">testing</a></b> by jason<ul></ul></ul></div><b>2000-04-06 - Power Failure</b><br>Two power outages occurred last night at
the Jason Complex causing the Linux box
to take a serious digger. I had to crawl
behind it and unplug the power supply.
Just another reason why I need an APS. I
think I'll seriously look into one now.
It makes me real nervous knowing that my
stuff can/will crash without be there.
<br><br>
On a lighter note I'm using Netscape 6
preview release 1 as my primary browser
now. I must say I am very happy with it.
It seems to be just as stable as
Netscape 4.72. I crashed once on both
browsers yesterday. The integrated AIM
client is interesting but what if I'm
not browsing the web and I want AIM to
be on? Well, I don't want to keep
Netscape open just be to connected to
AIM. So I think I'll stick with the
regular client for now unless
AOL/Netscape can figure something better
out.


<br>[<a href="comment.php?writecomment=1&amp;jid=24">Post a comment</a>]<br><br><div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><b>2000-04-05 - Fine Dining</b><br>Last night I went out to the greatest place on earth, Murray's in downtown Minneapolis. It's an upscale dining establishment. Luckily I didn't have to pay.<br>
I pulled up my poor little Honda to the front door where I was kindly greeted by the valet. Once inside it was straight out of a movie with hundreds of people waiting to serve you. I sat with my group in the "lobby" a.k.a. bar for a minute or two before being seated. Once seated we all perused the menu which was 75% steak, 25% other. So for someone of my tastes I thought I was out of luck. I did manage to find the 1 chicken item on the menu, simply titled "Chicken Breast." We all sat and talked for a couple of hours. It was a good time. <br> 
Have I mentioned before that I bought a Vaio? Yeah, one of those really tiny computers. I absolutely love it. I got the base model, 505ve, which is a Celeron 333, 64 megs of ram, 6.4 gig hard drive. It does the job and looks cool while doing it.<br>[<a href="comment.php?writecomment=1&amp;jid=23">Post a comment</a>]<br><br><div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><b>2000-03-25 - Mallrats</b><br>I had to reboot good ol' Broken-Industries this morning. After shattering my last personal best of 26 days my computer started spawning processes left and right. After killing just about everything I realized I should probably reboot it for safety's sake.
<br><br>
So, do you like the new redesign?<br>[<a href="comment.php?writecomment=1&amp;jid=22">Post a comment</a>]<br><br><div class="comments"><ul></ul></div>						</div>
