        Well, it turns out someone did....or at least my router. Somehow my router lost it's proper settings for download bandwidth and has had me capped at 192kbps, a fraction of what it should be. I thought I was going crazy. I thought someone was screwing with me, or that I had a virus. Nope, nothing that complicated. So I'm back now, in full DSL force.<br>

        I dragged Courtney to <b>The Matrix: Reloaded</b> this weekend. I ended up apologizing for it. The storyline was good but the directing and storytelling left something to be desired. There seemed to be a lot of fluff in the movie which wasn't necessary. If you were Neo would you hang around an fight a never-ending onslaught of Agent Smiths? Or would you just get the hell outta there from the get-go? I had a lot of hope for this movie. After watching the <b>Animatrix</b> episodes I was totally engrossed in the story. Sadly, the movie didn't fulfill my hopes. <br>

        It's been a loooong while since I've posted lyrics so I figured you'd forgive me if I did it just this once.<br><br>
<b>The District Sleeps Alone Tonight<br>
-The Postal Service</b><br><br>

Smeared black ink. <br>
Your palms are sweaty, <br>
And i'm barely listening <br>
To last demands. <br>
I'm staring at the asphalt, wondering <br>
what's buried underneath... <br>
Where I am. Where I am. <br>
Wear my badge <br>
A vinyl sticker with big block letters... <br>
Adhere it to my chest. <br>
Tells your new friends <br>
I am a visitor here; <br>
I am not permanent. <br>
And the only thing <br>
Keeping me dry is<br>
[Where I am.] <br>
You seem so out of context <br>
In this gaudy apartment complex. <br>
[Where I am.]<br>
A stranger with your doorkey <br>
Explaining that i am just visiting.<br>
[Where I am.]<br>
I am finally seeing<br>
Why I was the worth leaving.<br>
The district sleeps alone tonight,<br>
After the bars turn out their lights.<br>
Descend(?) the art of swerving<br>
Into the loneliest evening. <br><br>

        Last week Courtney and I ventured to the Woman's Club to catch the Dan Wilson/Mike Doughty super-combo concert. It was my first trip to the Woman's Club. I wasn't expecting an actual "club." We walked in the front door of the club instead of the backdoor entrance to the auditorium. We were soon swimming through old ladies attending some sort of function. I can only assume the women were there to do actual women stuff at the Woman's Club. We got lost trying to find the proper stairwell into the basement and ended up in a fancy dining hall. After some odd looks and crossed-eyes, we managed to make it to the auditorium.<br><br>
The concert was good. Dan Wilson was much, much better than I had expected. He had an interesting crew backing him up on vocals and miscellaneous instruments. Mike Doughty played fast, and on an electric guitar. I can't say I was too impressed with his solo stuff because it sounded exactly like it did the first 100 times I listened to his live disc. But then he brought out Andy Thompson, the drummer/pianist/violinist who was backing Dan during his set and they rawked the house. After speeding through a ton of different songs, including Down in the Well, Dan Wilson came back on to join Mike for the encore. They proceeded to do a 6 to 8 song duet encore that was nothing short of amazing. They even snuck in American Car which made my evening. The crowd shouted for a Firetruck duet and Mike gave Dan that look of willingness but Dan couldn't remember the words....or was it the melody? Either way the crowd couldn't convince him.<br><br>
I'd give the show a solid 'A' grade. I was hoping for something new and interesting and they delievered. It was well worth the money.<br>

        I've been nursing some normal springtime allergies last week when I was hit with a train-wreck cold/flu on Sunday evening. I haven't been this sick in many, manay moons. I started to think about it and realized I hadn't been this sick since I lived at my folks place five years ago. I drew the connection between yard work. I've lived in apartments for the past 5 years and never had to worry about fixing brown patches of grass. But now as a happy homeowner I have to do these things. Which tends to make my allergies act up and get me sick. <br><br>
I slept for most of Monday. I was awoken at noon with a phone call from work. It took me two more hours to venture to Target to finally get some medicine. I realized, though, that I didn't really buy any medicine that was going to cure me, but just medicine that would hide the effects of the cold. Nonetheless I feel much better than this morning. The only down side is that I think I gave it to my wife. Ouch.<br><br>
X-Men 2 ruled. If you thought the ending was odd, they are leading into the Pheonix Prophecy storyline of X-Men. They spent months of crossovers writing the story in the early 90s, the did it in the cartoon version of X-Men, and now it will find it's way onto the silver screen. I don't really dig the Pheonix storyline. Hopefully it'll play out better on the big screen. I do hope we see more of Colossus too in the next one.<br>

        I'm currently doing a lot of copying and pasting of stored procedure names. I'm copying from a text file to an Excel spreadsheet.<br><br>
I was cruising along, pasting away, when all of the sudden the word "Help" was pasted instead of the procedure name. I deleted it and pasted again. "Help." I looked around to see if anyone was messing with me.<br><br>
It was just one of those weird moments where I thought that maybe my computer was crying out for someone.<br>
