				<b>Weekend Recap</b><br>
<b>Friday</b> - After receiving a much needed paycheck Courtney and I hit the streets for a little fun. We ended up at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925041610/http://www.buffalowildwings.com/">Buffalo Wild Wings</a> in Plymouth (minus Rick and Susan 'cause we couldn't get ahold of them). I couldn't stop raving about it after I was there on Monday and Courtney happens to be a connoisseur of buffalo wings. It was a good time. We don't spend much time together hanging out at bars so it was a good bonding experience.<br><br>
<b>Saturday</b> - Court went riding. I went errand running. After riding Courtney jointed me on my errands. I did pick up some new media. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925041610/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXZ4/pauxpascom">Memento</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925041610/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/630549228X/pauxpascom">Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</a>. <b>Memento</b> was fabulous. It did live up to my expectations. <b>Lock, Stock</b> was also very good but it made Guy Ritchie's followup <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925041610/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003CXS4/pauxpascom">Snatch</a> look like a rehash. On CD I bought <b>Alien Ant Farm</b>'s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925041610/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005A7TW/pauxpascom">Anthology</a> (Who the hell told me they were punk?!) which I'm not very happy with and <b>Bend Folds</b>' latest <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925041610/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005NZKK/pauxpascom">Rockin' the Suburbs</a>. I'm probably quite biased but I really dig Folds latest outting. It's him minus the drummer and bassist (dime a dozen). It's harkens back to their first album. He doesn't take himself too seriously. The title track off the album speaks of the troubles of a male, middle class, american. Yeah, life's rough. For supper we headed to my aunt's to celebrate my grandmother's birthday. I was quick to note that I was the only grandchild who made an effort to be there. ;) Granted, the others are all 300 miles away. And at least one of them called. *cough*<br><br>
<b>Sunday</b> - I laid around ALL DAY. I goofed around on my computer. I ate food. I sat on my couch. Just like I like it. :)<br>

				I wonder how many movie scripts are flying around right now? I hope they get George Clooney to play the courageous fire chief. "Quick! Get that shot! Pan out! Pan out!" shouts from emmy award nominees were heard throughout all of the newscast reporting. I give it 2 weeks before we see a book for it, 'cause, you know, we should give SOME time for mourning.<br><br>

I'm vaguely motivated to do something more with the site. I'm getting that programming feeling back in me. The layout might change but that may be it on the frontend. I've got a ton of backend stuff I'd like to do.<br><br>

				<hr size="2" noshade>
				Well, as fast as fads come, they go. I'm not one to do much reading but I've been sucking down whatever I get my hands around lately. I picked up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925041610/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1573225517/pauxpascom/002-1732852-3110450">High Fidelity</a> on Sunday and finished it tonight. It's gotta be the fastest I've read a book since I finished X-Force #47 in '94 in 3 days. Luckily I recieved<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925041610/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446677450/pauxpascom">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a> in the mail today and I've been waiting to get a good jab at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925041610/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596001177/pauxpascom">Programming C#</a> also. I'll have some time next week on the plane rides too. Hmmm. I don't know if 2 books will be enough.<br><br>
Don't fear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010925041610/http://www.masonjennings.com/">Mason Jenning</a>'s self-titled album. It's laughably good.
