        Well, Chuck E. Cheese was a bust for the most part. I insisted on going there for my birthday with the family. Apparently they've removed all their video games in favor of physical activities for children. Which is good for the kids of today, to get a little exercise. I should have suggested Gameworks in downtown. Then we would have been assured a good time. Although I must say I think the experience was worth it to almost get beaten by an 8 eight year old in auto racing and the Vanilla Coke dispenser. It did make my day. My lovely parents also managed to get me a birthday cookie, just like I had asked. Yes, I will be 25, not 12. I figure birthdays are for oddball requests and weird situations. If I didn't have that, what good would a birthday be?<br><br><br>

        I picked up 3 new CDs this past week. I've been in the punk rawk mood so I was hoping to find some loud three-chord disc. I didn't find any true punk but I did find some discs to fill the void. The Mighty, Mighty Bosstones <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030319173355/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000068TZX/qid=1047612636/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_2/102-3182945-6926536">A Jack Knife to a Swan</a> is surprisingly swell. It quenches my Ska/Punk druthers for the month. It's been a long while since I've picked up a good ska album so I was happy to find this one. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030319173355/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000087QQK/qid=1047612732/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-3182945-6926536?v=glance&amp;s=music">The All-American Rejects</a> are going to be big. I think I caught them on MTV originally so it's not like they're hiding under a rock. It's good alterna-rock. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030319173355/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000069RL3/qid=1047612835/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-3182945-6926536">Bowling for Soup</a> is the closest I came to finding an actual punk disc. It's more pop-punk but I couldn't pass up a band who's album is titled, "Drunk Enough to Dance" and the cd sticker said something like, "Champagne quality at beer prices!"<br>

        I just unwrapped a copy of Orange 9mm's disc <b>Ultraman vs. Godzilla</b> which I've had in plastic wrap for well over 5 years. There's nothing special about the CD. I just never got around to opening it.<br>

        Last night Courtney and I ventured down to the 7th Street Entry for new band night to watch Josh and his band <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030319173355/http://www.daytriplovesyou.com/">Daytrip</a> make their debut. They were an excellent show. Very early emo-esque. Think Sunny Day Real Estate meets Placebo. They sit somewhere in the comfortable middle.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately the stars were not aligned properly, though. The drummer for Daytrip showed up late which cost them the coveted second spot on the setlist. They ended up going on at midnight which most of us oldtimers found a tad hard to swallow. But we toughed it out for Josh. We had to listen through a few other band. The Groove were a bunch of old guys who couldn't decided if they were a 50s rockabilly band or a contemporary rock band. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030319173355/http://www.icedink.net/">Iced Ink</a> were an awesome rawk band with no lyrics. The bassist was also this old guy who really didn't fit stylistically with the rest of the alternapunk members. The best part of the band was the addition of a percussionist to play cowbells and sandshakers. A very nice touch to the music. I was very impressed with them. The third night's entry were a tough pill to swallow. Hear Color, See Nothing were a metalcore/hard metal screaming band. When the Kurt Cobain look-alike first took the stage we wondered if they were kidding or serious. From what we could understand of their lyrics, they were really concerned about spilling their beers. After witnessing them I now believe ANYONE can play at the Entry. The best part about these guys was this oddball 4th band memeber who didn't sing and just sort of mingled in the middle of the stage smoking. Rico pointed out that they could have replaced him with a smoke machine and had more space on the stage. Don't get me wrong, the guy did have some purpose, but not much. He played the floppy drive. You know, like the one in your computer. I'm not kidding. In the middle of their stage set up was this receiver-like gizmo on a table which he would stick 3.5-inch floppy disks into. At the end of songs he would walk up to the gizmo and hit play and a sound-byte would play. He would then flip out the discs and continue rocking out and producing a massive amount of smoke until the next song ended. I don't think I'll ever use my computer the same way again after watching this genius master the art of the floppy disk. At one point he threw up his arms in disgust and started shouting at the other band members and pointing to his rig. The gizmo had obviously broken and he was upset. Luckily for us, he did get it fixed.<br/><br/>
So, where am I going with this? Well, we filed out of the Entry at about 12:30am after watching Daytrip end the night nicely and headed back to our cars. This morning was a little rough but I made it to work. Mitch got stopped by the cops on his way home and had to take a breathalizer, which he passed with flying colors. And Josh and co. didn't get home until 5am after one of the band members had their car towed.<br/><br/>
So, if you didn't read any of the prior blathering I'll summarize: Late night, good music, great stories.

        Well, good news on the Gizmo front. The SonicBlue D2730 DVD player I've been waiting for finally went up for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030319173355/http://www.sonicblue.com/shop/_templates/item_main.asp?model=168&amp;cat=37">pre-order</a> this weekend. Although the price is 50 bucks more than it was slated to be. I can tolerate it. Also, Linksys announced they were going to be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030319173355/http://news.com.com/2100-1040-985192.html">releasing</a> a version of the Intel media adapter by the end of May rather than this fall. Although the option to view video seems surprisingly absent. If none of these devices pan out to be the end-all-be-all with digtial media I'll probably just end up building a media server with one of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030319173355/http://www.newegg.com/app/Showimage.asp?image=56-101-208-15.jpg/56-101-208-17.jpg/56-101-208-21.jpg/56-101-208-23.jpg/56-101-208-19.jpg/56-101-208-20.jpg/56-101-208-25.jpg/56-101-208-24.jpg/56-101-208-18.jpg/56-101-208-14.jpg">Shuttle</a> cases.<br><br>
Rico's back in town for a week. It's good to see his ugly mug around the office. He definately lifted the spirits of a lot of us. Sometimes fightin' the good fight gets a little tiring and lonely. It's good to have one of our troops back.<br>
