The coffee is just starting to kick in. I'm beginning the "Who's looking over my back" paranoia. <br>I've been listening to some crazy music lately. Without good music being made I've resorted to the Rocky Horror Picture Show, Madonna, and The Partridge Family. Crazy. It was so much easier to find good music when I was a Music Director. I'm sure there is good music out there on some radio station, but where?<br>I attended a cocktail party this weekend. Basically it was an excuse to dress up. Or in my case, a reason to make an ass of myself in public. It was a good time for the first few hours but the novelty of it all wore off after that. Then I was just tired and I wanted to go home. Hopefully I will have pictures later this week.<br>School is becoming a drag. After failing my first test miserably my spirits have broken about school. I definitely wasn't the only one with a bad grade. Most of the class did poorly. I'm pulling for a curve. <br>Take on me....

late night...<br>need coffee...<br>quickly...<br><br>I've been taking a lot of webcam requests lately. It's really weird when people are writing asking for the "dude sign" or whatnot. It gives me a laugh anyway. I haven't had time to dork around for awhile. I'm kicking around the idea of writing a computer gaming column for IBS. We have access to the editors and they are more than willing to allow us to try our hand at writing if it is quality work. I've seen what they consider quality and I think I can write at least, if not better, than their work. Just give me my spell checker. <br><br>Bojay wants to do a slashdot type thing with computerjargon. I'm all for it. The first step to creating a massive site like slash is the backend database. So I installed a quality product called PostgresSQL as suggested by Mr. 'jay himself. Why not MySQL? I dunno. So I install it, type psql and errors abound. This isn't your daddy's SQL. So anyway, I'll have to call "Tech Support" for help on this one. No doubt after reading this I will get the famous email "You Rang?" Ha. Kudos to Bojay for helping me babystep through linux.<br><br>The graphics dept. is quickly assembling a large collection of new G4s. Their computer turnaround rate is about 6 months. My poor P2 400 probably won't be replaced for at least two years. So I mentioned this to the higher-ups. Okay, Okay, I complained. Hopefully we'll be getting 21 inch monitors now. I told them that a bigger monitor would be cool, or multiple monitors. Either or. Hehe..

</table><p><font size="2"><b>11.1.99 - Rules
</b><br>
Here are the rules to contacting Jason:<br><br>I have many methods of communicating. I will dicuss the methods using the Internet here because, well, I don't want people calling me or mailing me stuff. <br>I have two email accounts:<br><br><b>jason@ibsys.com</b><br><b>jason@broken-industries.com</b><br><br>My ibsys account is for work, <i>bi</i> for personal stuff. I check both accounts while I am at work. I check <i>bi</i> while I am at home. I do not check ibsys at home. There's too much junk mail on my ibsys account. I do not mind personal email to my ibsys account. If you do send email to my ibsys account I will not get it on the weekends. <br><br>I have two AOL Instant Messenger accounts:<br><br><b>brokenindu</b><br><b>brokeninhome</b><br><br><i>brokenindu</i> is my work account. I can be reached through <i>brokenindu</i> when I am at work. <i>brokeninhome</i> is my home account. Both accounts are always logged in. I never use the away message crap. And the accounts are on all the time, not just when I'm sitting by the computer. So when you see <i>brokenindu</i> on at 3am Saturday morning it does not mean I am at work. <br><br>I have one ICQ account:<br><br><b>44577843 - Breakdown</b><br><br>I have this on at work. I don't use it much because I don't know many other people that use it. Just as with my work AIM account it is on all the time. No matter if I'm at work or not. NT's implementation of ICQ blows. It's horrible. It always says that I'm unavailable. I've given up on trying to get it to work right.<br><br>My hours are:<br><br>7am - 5pm - Work<br>6pm - ~10pm - Home<br><br>If you try and contact me outside of those hours I am not around. My hours are very tight. I live by them. <br><br><b>A Note about the Webcam</b><br>This thing has become more popular than I had thought. I'm working on setting up a home webcam although I do have some reservations about it. I don't know if I'm ready to allow others full access to what I do all the time. I do need SOME privacy. <br><br>When the webcam at work is down, I know about it. This morning I recieved 5 separate messages stating that the webcam was down. Yes, I knew that. Yes, I consciously didn't turn it back on because I feared beating my NT machine to death. NT blows. There, I said it. It sucks. The software for it sucks. My webcam software crashes a lot. I get sick of rebooting to bring the webcam back up. So there. The webcam is working.

I've been working diligently for 3 and 1/2 hours now. I think it's time for a little reflection. <br><br>Broken Radio is back online at port 8000 if that means anything to any of you. For those that know about shoutcast and WinAmp it will make sense. I'll be posting explicit instructions on how to access Broken Radio just as soon as broken-industries.com's backend gets an upgrade. =) Stay tuned.<br><br>I have a wrist-rest now at work. I hate it.<br><br>Today at noon I get to hear about the new things coming out of Allaire. I'm very enthused to hear about the latest and greatest things coming out of this company. Even though I do have many beefs with their bugfilled Homesite 4.01 they do make my life easier. Plus they just announced Cold Fusion 4.5 for Linux. Good call on their part. I've done very little Cold Fusion in my life. I've realized that most if not all of it's functionality is covered in PHP, Cold Fusion gives me my job.

Well, well, well. It turns out that Broken Radio is a little more exciting than I thought. Currently Broken Radio is experiencing technical difficulties (read: I screwed something up) but rest assured that I will set it up tonight and get those MP3s streaming again. <br><br>On the lighter side of life I enjoyed a very nice evening last night. All the way up until midnight when the couple living below me began having wild and crazy sex. For the next two hours I listened to, "Yes! Yes! No! No! No! Yes! Yes!" It ended with a couple of pounding sounds against the wall. I wonder what happened?<br><br>My Windoze machine is back in functioning order once again. Getting the PCI card order has been a bitch. But I was finally able to screw the cards in with confidence that the system would be stable. I think I have a bad SCSI cable though. That's another day.<br><br>Kudos to Bojay for catching this <a href="images/1.jpg">picture</a> on my webcam.
