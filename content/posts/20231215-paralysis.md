I get stuck in starting on the most basic tasks. This blog is a prime example. I have so many lists in so many different tools of topics that have been rattling around in my head for years. When my daughter gets stuck in her own analysis paralysis I tell her to just start, take a first step, just do.

I'm going to take my own advice. Here's a nonsensical, non-prioritized, non-complete, brain dump of topics that will blog about at some point:

- [ ] How to start a new job
- [ ] Waiting / validating opinions
- [ ] Imposter syndrome
- [ ] feedback
- [ ] how to start anything
- [ ] setting and measuring expectations
- [ ] how to build consensus
- [ ] It's ok to not be a tech firm
- [ ] How much time does it take to be a manager?
- [x] Zettelkasten
- [ ] Korn Ferry
- [ ] Personal and professional reading list
- [x] BAPO
- Projects
  - [ ] Rawk it
  - [ ] Home Assistant
  - [ ] Raffl.online
  - [ ] joels.photography
  - [x] computerjargon.com
  - [ ] Architecture of jason.motylinski.com
- Books reviews
  - [x] Shape up
  - [ ] Three Body Problem
  - [ ] The Creative Act
