I picked up [The Creative Act](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Act-Way-Being/dp/0593652886/) because it is [Rick Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin). I was intrigued because it isn't a memoir of his career in the music industry. [The Creative Act](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Act-Way-Being/dp/0593652886/) is Rick's take on the act of creativity. It is his advice and approach to the creative flow. With such a heady concept I figured I could find inspiration in it and apply it to my life.

Rick Rubin is a music icon. He's responsible for launching careers like [Run DMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-DMC) and the [Beastie Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys). He's responsible for career pivots like Tom Petty's [first record without the Heartbreakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildflowers_(Tom_Petty_album)) and Johnny Cash's [American recordings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recordings_(album)) late in his career. Rubin plays no instrument and yet is able to illicit greatness from the artists he works with. [The Creative Act](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Act-Way-Being/dp/0593652886/) is a glimpse into how he's able to pull greatness out of them.

I'm going to start with reviewing the physical book itself. I walked by it at Barnes and Noble and felt the hardcover. It's beautiful and feels beautiful. The book is minimalistic with even the UPC being a sticker added afterwards (and easy to remove). During checkout the cashier did a double-take when it rang up at $35. "Prices are getting out of control," she said. It is pricey but it looks and feels like a book deserving of space in your library.

The book is comprised of 78 chapters. The chapters only loosely follow a process flow. Each chapter is only a handful of pages and can be read out of context (like a reference) from the rest of the book. I chose to read the book from cover to cover. I can see myself thumbing through it for reference in the future.

_overview of interesting points_

Rubin states you must open yourself to take inspiration from anywhere and I agree. While the book speaks to the creative process I found many of the points are easily applicable to leadership. I enjoyed finding inspiration in his words that weren't so specific to software engineering.
