I picked up [The Creative Act](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Act-Way-Being/dp/0593652886/) because it is [Rick Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Rubin). I was intrigued because it isn't a memoir of his career in the music industry. [The Creative Act](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Act-Way-Being/dp/0593652886/) is Rick's take on the act of creativity. It is his advice and approach to the creative flow. With such a heady concept I figured I could find inspiration in it and apply it to my life.

Rick Rubin is a music icon. He's responsible for launching careers like [Run DMC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-DMC) and the [Beastie Boys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastie_Boys). He's responsible for cgggggareer pivots like Tom Petty's [first record without the Heartbreakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildflowers_(Tom_Petty_album)) and Johnny Cash's [American recordings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recordings_(album)) late in his career.<img align="right" style="padding-left: 10px; width:400px" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/oan/images/uploads/johnny-cash-09w.jpg"> Rubin plays no instrument and yet is able to illicit greatness from the artists he works with. [The Creative Act](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Act-Way-Being/dp/0593652886/) is a glimpse into how he's able to pull greatness out of them.

Let me start with the physical book itself. I walked by it at Barnes and Noble and felt the hardcover. It's beautiful and feels beautiful. The book is minimalistic with even the UPC being a sticker added afterwards (and removed easily). During checkout the cashier did a double-take when it rang up at $35. "Prices are getting out of control," she said. It is pricey but it looks and feels like a book deserving of space in your library.

The book is comprised of 78 chapters. The chapters  loosely follow a creative flow from inspiration, through creating, and finally delivering. Each chapter is a handful of pages and can be read out of context (like a reference) from the rest of the book. Early chapters cover topics like "Practice", "Inspiration" and "Experimentation". The middle portion of the book is about creating - "Crafting" and "Breaking Sameness". It ends with chapters about "Freedom" and "The Energy (in the work)" which touch on how to move on to a new idea and continue crafting.

In between many chapters are small inspirational quotes. I assume they are directly from Rubin as no other author is attributed. The quotes felt like bite-size consumable points for the upcoming chapter. The quotes themselves weren't all that insightful but helped punctuate a point.

I chose to read the book from cover to cover to get a sense of the complete process, though it wasn't necessary. In fact, I think reading chapters out of context would be more impactful. The later chapters repeated points or felt like they were making a mountain out of a mole hill.

Rubin says you must open yourself to take inspiration from anywhere. I agree. While the book focuses the creative process I found many of the points are easily applicable to leadership. I enjoyed finding inspiration in his words that weren't so specific to software engineering. 

Here are a few points that really resonated with me:

- __page 153__ - "If you know what you want to do and do it, that's the work of a craftsman. If you begin with a question and use it to guide adventure and discovery, that's the work of an artist." - Seems very akin to the difference between the Discovery and Delivery phases in the SDLC.
- __page 189__ - "Limit the information to the barest..." and "If you want creators to bring all of themselves to something, give them the most freedom to create." - Speaks to empowering teams and individuals to be leaders. Don't micromanage. Give space for them to do their jobs.
- __page 216__ - "If you think, 'I don't like it but someone else will'..you're in the business of commerce." - As a leader we are expected to have our own voice. We have been put into a leadership position because of our expertise, not simply to say "yes".
- __page 226__ - "Practice detachment" - The advice is learn how to take a step back from the immediate problem or assumed solution to see the whole picture. Remove whatever attachment you have to the situation so you can more objectively evaluate it.
- __page 236__ - "Be aware of strong responses" - What does it mean to have a strong emotional reaction to something? Why are you feeling that way? Realize when it's happening, lean into the emotion and figure out why you are having it
- __page 295__ - "The artists job is of two kinds: the work of doing [and] the work of being." As a leader you must care about the work and why you are doing the work. You are expected to execute as well as understand the context of the execution.
- __page 306__ -  "We can ...improve our creations through A/B testing" - I love to see a method applied different workflows. While engineering is familiar with A/B testing, it feels like a novel approach when applied to the creative process.
- __page 347__ - "The best work is the work you are excited about." - Amen. It begs the question - how do you do your best work if you aren't excited?"
- __page 361__ - "Creativity is contagious. When we spend time with other artistic people, we absorb and exchange a way of thinking." - The benefits of an in-person culture have been hard to articulate. Return to office mandates are unpopular and face a lot of resistance. We have to admit that productivity is not driver of RTO...but then what is? I think the concept of a the "artistic community" called an "Sangha" nails it.
- __page 372__ - "Competition serves the ego. Cooperation supports the highest outcome." - I found this very inspirational. A good reminder why it's better to work as a team vs. against each other. When I find myself fighting for space, priority, alignment, etc...this is a good reminder to take a step back and clarify the outcomes.
- __page 388__ - "Making the simple complicated is commonplace. Making the complicated simple, that's creativity " - Charles Mingus - A kind reminder where the value of a solution exists.

Reading [The Creative Act](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Act-Way-Being/dp/0593652886/) feels like sitting next to Rubin asking for advice. The book is his philosophy, his thought process. It's not a prescription or description of a specific approach. It feels best used when you are at a crossroads and looking for a push in one direction.

Rubin could have written an autobiography. He could have written a book of stories from the road. He could have written about his specific creative process. Instead, he chose to write about his wisdom. Once I accepted the book for what it was, and let go of what I wanted it to be, I enjoyed it immensely.
