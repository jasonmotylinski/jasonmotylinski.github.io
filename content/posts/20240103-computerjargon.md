I purchased the [Computerjargon.com](https://www.computerjargon.com) domain name back in 1998, shortly after I started my first job as a "web programmer". I was working for a now-defunct company called Moore Data Management Systems in Minneapolis. The internet boom was just starting to take off and I was trying to ride it's wave.

I had been developing web pages and perl scripts since 1993. I remember updating HTML to be compliant with Netscape 1.0 in high school. I worked as a contractor converting Word docs to HTML while I was in college. Moore Data was my first professional job. My job was to create HTML templates which rendered real estate data from their custom SQL server. [Computerjargon.com](https://www.computerjargon.com) was going to be my sanctuary from the monotony of the corporate world.

[Computerjargon.com](https://www.computerjargon.com) was many things over the next decade but I mostly settled on using it as my personal blog. As friends joined the internet community I used [Computerjargon.com](https://www.computerjargon.com) to be my personal internet hub, linking off to their respective corners of the web. I shared personal stories of growing up and becoming parents on [Computerjargon.com](https://www.computerjargon.com). I used my blog to say whatever I needed to sway

With the rise of Facebook and Twitter my personal blog became pass√©. I used Facebook to share any personal stories and had no need for [Computerjargon.com](https://www.computerjargon.com). I used Twitter to talk about technology. Eventually I retired [Computerjargon.com](https://www.computerjargon.com) and redirected it to [Jason.Motylinski.com](https://jason.motylinski.com).

I've long given up Facebook and Twitter, realizing that shouting into an echo chamber doesn't bring a lot of satisfaction. I've decided to restart blogging but this time for myself. 

I've kept a lot of data and documents over the years, but the content from 1998 - 2010s of [Computerjargon.com](https://www.computerjargon.com) seemed to have slipped by me. I was upset that so much of my life had been lost.

I decided to try the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) in hopes that it had caught some of [Computerjargon.com's](https://www.computerjargon.com) history. To my surprise the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) had lots of my former blog content. It had captured the first page I published in 1999 all the way thru the site going stale in 2010.

I wrote a quick script to download my content from [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) to preserve it and __published the [Computerjargon.com Archives](projects/computerjargonarchives/) online__ for posterity's sake. The archive contains snapshots from 1999 thru 2010. Much of the content is very cringe-worthy but I like to peruse it from time to time. The archives contain so many forgotten memories.
