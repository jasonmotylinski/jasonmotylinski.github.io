"__Why me?__" I find myself thinking in many meetings. Why am I in the room? What does this group need from me? I'm often in situations where teammates or peers or my direct reports are looking to me to make a decision. I am invited into a technical debates to help decide which direction to take our platform or looped into project status updates to help remove blocks. But what makes me or my role special? I'm not most technical person in the room anymore. The team has more context than I do about situation.

I'm typically brought into these conversations to give permission on a decision. The team feels that they must gain approval before they can move forward. 

The book (Turn this Ship Around!)[https://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/] introduced me to the concept of __"I intend to.."__. Simply put, when you find yourself asking permission from a person change the sentence to __"I intend to..."__ On the surface it seems like a very innocuous change, but it causes a change in thought process that is powerful.

Take for instance a proposal to use a new cloud service. These kinds of decisions typically require some debate. Does it fit within our broader architecture? What is the cost model? How many teams will leverage the service? All these require a level of alignment and commitment and are the kinds of conversations I'm brought in to. When these questions come up I will ask my team to tell me what they __intend_ to do instead of asking for permission. Usually they start walking through all these questions themselves telling me that they need to build alignment before moving forward. 

Using the cloud service example - I am not the right person to answer if it fits into our broader architecture, our Staff engineers are. I am no the right person to evaluate how many teams can use the new service, that's a conversation for our engineering community and tech leads. The leader proposing the change should feel enough sense of ownership to have these conversations with their peers. With enough alignment and buyin from the peers I will of course be on board with the direction. But I alone am not the decision maker.

Another example is repriortizing work. Engineering Managers 

Using "I intend to.." still requires leaders to be informed. When they come to me saying, "I intend to use the new SaaS service (fill in your favorite)" I'm going to ask all the relevant questions above. Because they have thought through the implications of the decision I'm simply verifying they have been thorough. It makes decision-making much faster as it pushes the conversation out to the right people instead of the reporting lines.

You may have noticed I skipped over budget in my example. Cost and budget is something my role does have unique accountability for so there is a level of decision-making I must weigh in on. I chose to handle that by creating much more transparency into the budgeting process with my leaders. I want them to know the impact of their recommendation. We have also built up a level of understanding that we know asking for $1000 annual spend is a much lower risk than asking for $50,000.

I encourage you to give "I intend to.." a try. Instead of asking for someone's permission try telling them what you intend to do. See what results you get.
