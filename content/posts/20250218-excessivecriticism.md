__[Excessive Criticism is a Sign of Internal Conflict (Projecting)](https://kupajo.com/excessive-criticism-is-a-sign-of-internal-conflict-projecting/)__ - People take communication for granted. Communication, while natural, isn't easy. Effective communication is hard. Actively listening is something I consciously focus on to improve my understanding of the information someone else is sharing. 

One of the triggers I've picked up on is when someone is overly critical of an individual over the individual's behavior. [kupajo](https://kupajo.com/) identifies this behavior as projecting personal insecurities onto another person as the subconscious reasoning for critiquing.

As a leader I want to get to the root of the problem. A person is sharing (even if poorly) an issue they are having with an individual or an individual's behavior or situation. Feedback is more objective and actionable when redirected to the behavior or situation. Focusing on the behavior/situation creates distance between the involved parties and the problem being addressed.
