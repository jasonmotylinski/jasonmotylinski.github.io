__[My approach to running a link blog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/)__ (via) - I'm a bit late to the party on blogmarks but I'm finally here. Will argues in a different post that [you should blog](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/) but the stress of being interesting and topical becomes the barrier. To reduce that stress Will developed a pattern called __Blogmarks__ to give himself space to be imperfect and reduce the amount of initial effort to start writing.

The concept is simple - Share an interesting link. Leave a comment on it. Much like this post. I thought I'd give it a shot.

There are other social media platforms that allow you to do this as well, but I'd argue they are much less personal and much less fullfilling than sharing on my corner of the internet.

I redoubled my efforts to start blogging again at a very stressful time of my life. I needed an outlet that wasn't work focused. I created a backlog of topics and I set a goal to blog every two weeks. For a few months it kept me sane while I dealt with some not-so-great things at work. Then my job changed I had to take a different approach to blogging. 

I still have my backlog of topics and I will get to them. But I've also succumbbed to the stress of the 'blank sheet of paper'. I want to get back into blogging. Writing is cathartic and I enjoy it. I'm hoping the blogmark style of posting lowers the bar for myself.
