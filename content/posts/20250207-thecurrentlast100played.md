I love [89.3 The Current](https://www.thecurrent.org/). Even in this day and age of streaming on-demand music I appreciate the DJ's artfully crafted playlists. Their ability to weave Tony Bennett into a 90s R&B set cannot be replicated by AI. 

While I like to listen to it live I also love the convenience of my Spotify. I really love the ability to just set a song on repeat and skip past songs that aren't quite my jam. Also, I'm no longer in the same time zone as The Current. Listening live can be sometimes a bit off for the time of day, getting an extremely eclectic music block by the overnight DJ as my coffee music can be jarring.

Awhile ago someone much smarter than myself created a Spotify playlist which automatically updated with the last 100 songs played by The Current. It was a pure genius, combining the ease of Spotify with the smarter-than-AI tastes of The Current DJs. I loved it and listened to it daily.

Unfortunately the playlist went dark for some reason. It was removed from Spotify and finding the original author was almost impossible. I decided to leverage the playlist parsing logic I created for [rawk-it.com](https://www.rawk-it.com) and resurrect the playlist myself:

There's no magic here. It's simply updating the playlist when a new song is played on The Current. But now I can get the best sets by the best DJs at my fingertips again. Kudos to the creator of the original playlist. Wish I knew who you were so I could give you a shout out.
