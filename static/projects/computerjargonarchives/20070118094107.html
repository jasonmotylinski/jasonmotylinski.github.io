<div class="contenttext">
<p>My DVR from Comcast (it&#8217;s no Tivo, that&#8217;s for sure) had crapped out on us last weekend so I took it back to our local Comcast center to exchange it for a working one. I got back home and wired the working unit back up to the television. Upon firing it up I was surprised to find shows already recorded on it. I laughed at what had been taped, The O.C., Days of our Lives, and&#8230;Resident Sex. It turned out that the previous owner of my DVR was not only a soap opera fan, but also dug hardcore porn. It was no late night HBO special either, it was the real deal. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should be stunned, appalled, or entertained.</p>

<div class="contenttext">
<p>Well, it was that time of the decade again, time for my 5 year dental checkup. When I was a child my parents were very strict about our dentist visits. Every 6 months we would get poked, prodded, and chastised for not flossing. To this day, though, I have had very little dental problems.<br/>
The fact of the matter is, I should have gotten braces when I was a kid. I should have had my bottom teeth realigned somehow. My parents asked the dentist when I was 14 about it but he said that I should wait until I was 18 to see how puberty shook out. Well, puberty didn&#8217;t solve anything.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2001. I managed to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070118094107/http://www.computerjargon.com/2001/12/20/simmer-down/">crack my own tooth</a> with my upper jaw. Because my teeth are off kilter the top teeth crunch down on the wrong spot on my bottom teeth. In 2001 I went to the dentist for the first time in 5 years to correct the problem.</p>
<p>Fast forward to September 2006. Because my jaw is still misaligned I managed to chip/crack the same tooth that had the problem in 2001. My jaw began to ache and became sensitive to cold weather.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, after yet-another-5-year-sabbatical I went back to the dentist today. The hygienist was a little put off by the fact that I hadn&#8217;t been to see any dentist in 5 years but after a few minutes she said to her own surprise, &#8220;Wow, everything looks good. It&#8217;s like you were here 6 months ago.&#8221; I chalk that up to my toothbrush.<br/>
The dentist was a very large Russian man. He was quite intimidating but also quite nice. He was able to confirm that I had cracked my own tooth yet again. He told me that my filling will need to be replaced and that he felt it was a very &#8220;basic&#8221; filling (a.k.a. I had a shotty job done last time). I was a little perturbed by his statement because I had gone to a large corporate dentist office last time. I assumed because it was part of my actual insurer&#8217;s medical clinics that they would do the best job. According to this dentist, that was not the case. And the lousy job probably contributed to the repeat problem.</p>
<p>So, back I go next week to finish up the job. I hope this time they will heed my warning about Novocaine (I need lots of it).</p>

<div class="contenttext">
<p>Christmas was a whirlwind around our house. Even though I had a full week off to enjoy being with the family the days passed quickly. We spent our time going between houses, showing of Riley, and generally having a good time.</p>
<p>For Christmas Riley started smiling. It might seem like a simple thing but babies aren&#8217;t born with a smile on their face. For the first 6 weeks he would accidentally smile. You could tell it wasn&#8217;t real because he couldn&#8217;t repeat it. A few days before Christmas we got Riles up in the morning and to our surprised he gave us this big smile after he recognized us. It was odd because he doesn&#8217;t usually acknowledge us much except that we picked him up and he would stop crying. For the first time our kid was excited to see us! He continued to smile at us for a good half hour every time his eyes focused on us.</p>
<p>Ever since then he smiles when we get him up in the morning&#8230;.Oh, yeah, and right after he drops a load in his diaper too.</p>

<p>For Christmas my parents were kind enough to get both me and Drew video cameras. In between the time of one-upping each other in Wii bowling you&#8217;ll probably see a few videos come across our sites. Drew has already started a library of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070118094107/http://www.ongoinglife.com/avery/">Avery videos</a>.</p>
<p>This is Riley&#8217;s web video debut: Riley Rolls Over. While technically he rolls and technically it&#8217;s &#8220;over&#8221;, you&#8217;ll notice his style is more of a screaming kick than a planned execution.</p>

<div class="contenttext">
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I gained a few pounds during Court&#8217;s pregnancy. I&#8217;d like to think it was a little sympathy weight. I mean, it&#8217;s hard to control yourself when your wife is craving chocolate. But, to be honest, I think she might have gained a little sympathy weight from me.</p>
<p>At one point in the summer, for about a week, Cold Stone was a staple of our evening dining. The corner gas station even implemented a $4-minimum to use a credit card because we&#8217;d go in there for snacks regularly.  All the while I used the excuse, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s because Courtney&#8217;s pregnant.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth? Well, I sort of used her whole comfort food situation to get what I wanted. Yeah, I&#8217;m a chocoholic. When I get around chocolate I have to eat it until it&#8217;s gone. I would say to Courtney &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m going to the store. Do you need anything?&#8221; I knew full well that she agree with me that chocolate was a necessity.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m a few pounds heavier than I&#8217;d like to be. I still hit the gym regularly so if I can keep the food in check the pounds should come off easy.</p>

<p class="p">Riley is 7 weeks old today. He&#8217;s starting to change already. He&#8217;s starting to come out of the fetal looking stage and is starting to look like an actual baby. He&#8217;s starting to enjoy being awake, which is good and bad. It&#8217;s good in the sense that we don&#8217;t have a screaming baby all the time. It&#8217;s bad because he wants to be entertained the entire time.</p>
</div>
<div align="left">
<p class="p">From day one Riles hasn&#8217;t been too crazy about laying on his back. He&#8217;s been holding his head up since birth, albeit for short periods of time. Now, though, he insists on being held upwards so he can stare at the lights (a habit that must run in the family because Avery, my nephew, has a similar fetish).</p>
</div>
<div align="left">
<p class="p">For the first time Riles slept through the night last night. From 10pm-ish to 5am, it was nice to get at least one night of full sleep. Although I wish he would repeat it tonight, I know our luck probably won&#8217;t stretch that far.</p>
<p class="p">
<p class="p"><strong>UPDATE: </strong>After telling everyone all day long that today Riley turned 7 weeks old, Courtney and I realized that it was actually yesterday that he turned 7 weeks old&#8230;.heh&#8230;</div>

<div class="contenttext">
<p>After 8 years of vowing to write my own blogging software I have given in and admitted that I will never complete the project. After reading about Jamie&#8217;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070118094107/http://www.thingelstad.com/index.php/2006/11/25/migrating-text-to-wordpress/">successful </a>Wordpress conversion I decided to give it a shot myself. A few hours later I was up and running with all my old content ported over. All in all, I&#8217;m quite happy with the Wordpress software. It&#8217;s very slick and easy to work with.</p>
<p>Because of this, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070118094107/http://www.puckwucker.com/">Puckwucker.com</a> received a facelift as well. Courtney no longer has to put up with my rudimentary design skills. She can finally have a decent looking site.</p>

<p>I dub The Decemberists latest album <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070118094107/http://www.amazon.com/Crane-Wife-Decemberists/dp/B000HKDEEW/sr=8-1/qid=1165845575/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-3794376-2980842?ie=UTF8&amp;s=music">The Crane Wife</a> my favorite album for December. Specifically, the last track on the album <strong>Sons and Daughters</strong> is worthy of multiple spins during the day.</p>
<p>And if you weren&#8217;t aware, Stephen Colbert has accused the Decemberists of riding his coattails after the band issued a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070118094107/http://www.mtvu.com/reanimatethedecemberists/">green-screen challenge</a>, a homage to Colbert&#8217;s original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070118094107/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/videos/greenscreen_challenge/index.jhtml">green screen challenge</a>.</p>
<p>The Decemberists retort? A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070118094107/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/39928/Exclusive_Decemberists_Counterchallenge_Colbert">guitar solo counter-challenge</a>.</p>
<p>Pure genius on both parts.</p>
