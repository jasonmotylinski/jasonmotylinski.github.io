</b><br>
Here are the rules to contacting Jason:<br><br>I have many methods of communicating. I will dicuss the methods using the Internet here because, well, I don't want people calling me or mailing me stuff. <br>I have two email accounts:<br><br><b>jason@ibsys.com</b><br><b>jason@broken-industries.com</b><br><br>My ibsys account is for work, <i>bi</i> for personal stuff. I check both accounts while I am at work. I check <i>bi</i> while I am at home. I do not check ibsys at home. There's too much junk mail on my ibsys account. I do not mind personal email to my ibsys account. If you do send email to my ibsys account I will not get it on the weekends. <br><br>I have two AOL Instant Messenger accounts:<br><br><b>brokenindu</b><br><b>brokeninhome</b><br><br><i>brokenindu</i> is my work account. I can be reached through <i>brokenindu</i> when I am at work. <i>brokeninhome</i> is my home account. Both accounts are always logged in. I never use the away message crap. And the accounts are on all the time, not just when I'm sitting by the computer. So when you see <i>brokenindu</i> on at 3am Saturday morning it does not mean I am at work. <br><br>I have one ICQ account:<br><br><b>44577843 - Breakdown</b><br><br>I have this on at work. I don't use it much because I don't know many other people that use it. Just as with my work AIM account it is on all the time. No matter if I'm at work or not. NT's implementation of ICQ blows. It's horrible. It always says that I'm unavailable. I've given up on trying to get it to work right.<br><br>My hours are:<br><br>7am - 5pm - Work<br>6pm - ~10pm - Home<br><br>If you try and contact me outside of those hours I am not around. My hours are very tight. I live by them. <br><br><b>A Note about the Webcam</b><br>This thing has become more popular than I had thought. I'm working on setting up a home webcam although I do have some reservations about it. I don't know if I'm ready to allow others full access to what I do all the time. I do need SOME privacy. <br><br>When the webcam at work is down, I know about it. This morning I recieved 5 separate messages stating that the webcam was down. Yes, I knew that. Yes, I consciously didn't turn it back on because I feared beating my NT machine to death. NT blows. There, I said it. It sucks. The software for it sucks. My webcam software crashes a lot. I get sick of rebooting to bring the webcam back up. So there. The webcam is working.

I've been working diligently for 3 and 1/2 hours now. I think it's time for a little reflection. <br><br>Broken Radio is back online at port 8000 if that means anything to any of you. For those that know about shoutcast and WinAmp it will make sense. I'll be posting explicit instructions on how to access Broken Radio just as soon as broken-industries.com's backend gets an upgrade. =) Stay tuned.<br><br>I have a wrist-rest now at work. I hate it.<br><br>Today at noon I get to hear about the new things coming out of Allaire. I'm very enthused to hear about the latest and greatest things coming out of this company. Even though I do have many beefs with their bugfilled Homesite 4.01 they do make my life easier. Plus they just announced Cold Fusion 4.5 for Linux. Good call on their part. I've done very little Cold Fusion in my life. I've realized that most if not all of it's functionality is covered in PHP, Cold Fusion gives me my job.

Well, well, well. It turns out that Broken Radio is a little more exciting than I thought. Currently Broken Radio is experiencing technical difficulties (read: I screwed something up) but rest assured that I will set it up tonight and get those MP3s streaming again. <br><br>On the lighter side of life I enjoyed a very nice evening last night. All the way up until midnight when the couple living below me began having wild and crazy sex. For the next two hours I listened to, "Yes! Yes! No! No! No! Yes! Yes!" It ended with a couple of pounding sounds against the wall. I wonder what happened?<br><br>My Windoze machine is back in functioning order once again. Getting the PCI card order has been a bitch. But I was finally able to screw the cards in with confidence that the system would be stable. I think I have a bad SCSI cable though. That's another day.<br><br>Kudos to Bojay for catching this <a href="images/1.jpg">picture</a> on my webcam.

Allergy season has definately arrived. I am in the middle of a sneezing fit that is going on 5 minutes now. Time to break out the nasal decongestant. I'm very predictable when it comes to colds and sickness. Right around the first freeze is when I start feeling the symptoms but I don't get a full out cold until a major warmup after the freeze. The reverse is true in the spring. <br><br>I got some major reactions at work yesterday. I think that's what I was looking for anyway. I painted my fingernails black (Yea!) and wore some bigger earrings than usual. I was asked many times if I was planning on going as a woman for Halloween. I just told people that I've already done it many times before and if they will allow it I will dress up like a woman on Friday. I think that comment really stopped some people in their tracks. Although there were a few people who laughed.<br><br>Nothing new on the homefront. My week lightened up after a phone call yesterday. The depression was really starting to take a toll on me physically. I still am unable to sleep through the night. I sound like a baby but ever since Thursday of last week I am waking up 3 or 4 times a night. Or even worse, I'm waking up at 4:30 and not falling back to sleep before 6. Ish.<br><br>Tonight is Blair Witch Night. I have waited for this night ever since I first saw the Blair Witch Project a couple of months ago. My DVD arrived yesterday so tonight I'm turning off all the lights, unplugging my phone, getting drunk, and watching the Blair Witch Project in hopes of scaring the shit out of myself. People say, "How can you get scared when you've already seen it twice?" Come on, that tent scene with the kids is scary no matter how many times you see it.<br><br>P.S. Thank you everyone for the kind words throughout the weekend and Monday. They really helped me realize that I'm not as alone as I thought. :)<br>

I managed to leave my compound today. Although it was out of necessity. I've spent the past 3 days beating myself up inside. I feel like I deserve it though. I have lost the one thing that kept me going every day. The one reason why I am who I am. And the love of my life. So the past 3 days have been hell for me. I can't sleep or eat. I seem to be able to drink. Time for me to do some more soul searching and find a reason to live today.
