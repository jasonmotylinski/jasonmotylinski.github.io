<font size="2"><b>4.23.99 - Have you ever stopped to wonder why?
</b><br>
I am proud to say that this is my first entry from the "flipside" a.k.a. Linux. I've been playing with Linux for a few months now but it wasn't until recently that I started using it in a productive setting. I think just about every geek out there is has tried Linux or is planning on it. Linux is a good skill to learn. There is so much to the OS. It can be quite mind boggling. I realized that there is a lot about Windows that I take for granted. On the other hand, I can't believe how much I've learned in 4 months. Ultimately I hope to set up some sort of makeshift web server in my apartment so I can test my PERL scripts without uploading them first. <br>Sure, Linux is neat, but I must admit the best part about it is playing with the GUI. I have spent two weeks of lunch breaks hunting down the lastest X server, Gnome, KDE, and assorted window managers. The coolest app I have found yet would have to be Eterm which allows for transparent windows. Now <b>that</b> is cool. <br>For those who are wondering I finally finished off my second computer. The first thing I did when I took this new job was begin building my first computer from scratch. Actually, it all began as an upgrade plan. After 7 months of "updgrading" I had enough spare pieces to slap together another computer. The specs aren't very impressive but it'll work great for my little Linux Experiment.<br><b>Submissions</b><br>I'm looking for other geeks who would like to help create a virtual community of sorts. I'm not too sure what this virtual community would be yet but I figure, hey, there have got to be tons of people out there with spare time and coding knowledge. So if you are game send an email to: jason@computerjargon.com and I'll give a more detailed description as to what the future holds. <br>Secondly, I don't know if anyone finds the voting booth funny but I do. I think it's a laugh riot. I have spent my life being picked on and bullied because I'm a geek. So I decided to declare it and scream it from the hillsides. I AM A GEEK!! If you would like your picture used send it to: jason@computerjargon.com along with possible voting suggestions. If no suggestions are sent then I get to pick...which could be dangerous.<br>Next month look for the jargoncam to begin broadcasting. This month's budget just won't allow it today.<br>
<p>
<font size="2"><b>4.22.99 - Power of Communication
</b><br>
Okay, I'll admit, there isn't much point to Computer Jargon. It's basically a vast wasteland of my life and talents. But I didn't realize the power of communicating until yesterday. For some odd reason Computer Jargon recieved an extra 50 hits. 50 people that I did not know yesterday now know me and have read my stupid comments and my pointless commentary.<br><br>So with that in mind I will respect the power of communications. Although some have said I abuse that power with my long-winded rants. ;)<br><br>Computer Jargon has now been enhanced with a PERL journal program that allows me to enter these journal entries from a website instead of going in and editing the HTML every time I have something new I want to say. the journal program also displays the last 5 posts so those who have missed a couple of days can catch up.<br><br>I am a hack. And not a very good one at that. I mess around with my computers, I pick up things here and there. But I don't feel like I have a firm grasp on any one thing. I have talked with Internet Developers who say the ability to adapt is key to their profession. Well, how is someone like me supposed to get exposure to everything when I have such limited resources? I work as a Web Developer. When I was hired I had these ideas of grandure. I would come in and revolutionize their way of working! I would show them the right way, the good way, my way. But I quickly learned that they are not paying me for what I know, they are paying me to do what they want. They don't care that I know of better, faster, newer ways of accomplishing the same tasks. They just want me to code HTML.<br><br>I love HTML. But after working with it for 8 months day in and day out I realize it has it's limitations. I have picked up PERL and JavaScript in my extra time, when I'm not working at this God-forsaken hole. But who will hire an HTML hack with PERL knowledge?<br><br>Enough Soapbox. If you are a geek and have strayed from the path as I feel I have don't be afraid to write. I know we are out there, lost and confused. Send me your ideas, suggestions, rants, raves, etc... I hope to collect rants, raves, etc. from geeks everywhere to be published on Computer Jargon. <br>
<p>
<font size="2"><b>4.20.99 - Dynamic Site Creation
</b><br>
On the heals of a re-organization of Computer Jargon I have taken on the task of creating a dynamic entry system for these daily journals. This will make my job much easier. Unfortuneately I am attempting to apply some existing code to the current setup. The adopatation has not been the easiest. Although I did finish it all in one lunch break.
<p>
<font size="2"><b>4.19.99 - Mission Statement Update
</b><br>
Computer Jargon has gone through many transformations since it's conception in October of 1998. It began as a newshound site, transformed into a testing site, and came back online in January as a showcase for our talents. So what is Computer Jargon? Good question.<p>I admit it, I'm a geek. But a lost geek. I've attained the knowledge, I've got the resources, so what should I do? I think this is called a "crossroads."<p>So to answer the question, "What is Computer Jargon?" I'll tell you this. Computer Jargon is me. I am jargon made of computers. I am a confused man looking for an outlet. <b>Computer Jargon</b> is me and I am a geek.</font><p>
<p>
<font size="2"><b>4.15.99 - Computer Jargon Rebirth
</b><br>
<font size="2">For all potential Web developers remember this bit of knowledge: GIFs and JPEGs suck. If you check out the image on the left you will notice that GIF compression has caused the yellow to be a shade off. The worst part is the GIF picture looks so much better than the JPG. Looks like I'll be reworking it AGAIN in ImageReady.<p>Hopefully in the next week there will be a message board type system setup for beta testing. I would show you the development version but I'm afraid you might break it. ;) <p>P.S. Yes, there is a <b>mission statement</b>. No, I haven't typed it out yet. Hold your horses.<p>
