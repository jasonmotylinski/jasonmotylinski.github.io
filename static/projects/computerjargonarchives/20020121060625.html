								<b>2002-01-16 09:36:36 - Time to stop screwing around and get serious</b>
				<hr size="2" noshade>
				Ok, 3 days to go. People at work are starting to catch wind of the wedding. It's been sort of an odd situation here because I started the job right around the time we were finalizing a guest list. So no one from my new job has been invited. But they all seem good natured about it.<br><br>
The Jamaica tickets came in the mail on Monday. Got the traveler's checks and money for reverend and church. Got the new mp3 player. I'm good to go.<br><br>
Tonight I have to take Delia, our guinea pig, over to my parents house so that they can watch her while were away. I've tried to warn my parents that Delia is quite smart. She answers to a whistle and sometimes her name. If she doesn't get a carrot (or 3) for her good behavior she jumps around.<br><br>
Here's a little personal message to someone:<br>
Hey, you. Yeah, you. Out there. Just planning on coming to the beer-drinking portion of the reception. I just thought I would let you know that we think it's quite rude of you to just show up to drink beer. Everyone else is participating in the whole schabang. Hell, I even got Dave to agree to put on a tux. Dave, he can drink beer. Grant and Joe, they can too. But you can't. You are an ass. If you don't come to the whole thing then you aren't welcome to take our beer.<br><br>
Courtney and I are planning on merging our bank accounts. If you would have asked me last year about this time I would have had no part in a communal money pot. But times have changed, my friend. No longer am I the only one I need to support. It's a big step to reach out beyond my comfort zone like this. I will be ok. Nothing horrible will happen. right?<br><br>
Courtney told me there is one line I must memorize for the ceremony. I said, "I HAVE to?" and she said, "It's ONE line." So yes, I have to memorize just one line. Here it is. When I faulter I do expect someone there to shout out the rest for me:<br><br>
With this ring I thee wed and say to the world that this is woman who I cherrish above all others. <br><br>
Sounds simple right? Now imagine saying that in front of 160 people at your wedding. I think every one would be scared to death.<br>

				<div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><br><br>				<b>2002-01-14 07:40:10 - Time</b>
				<hr size="2" noshade>
				It seems I have grossly over-estimated the amount of free time I have. Since I was unable to post this weekend, here's a recap.<br><br>
Saturday was spent working on the programs and searching for spray-on glitter paint. It took us 4 hours to finally find the proper glitter. The time spent searching for the glitteer put a serious dent in the time we had to work on the programs. Luckily Heather and Justin stopped by to help. But at 5:30pm I had to exit, affectively killing the program assembly party. I was off to my bachelor's party at the Dubliner.<br><br>
We all sat at the Dubliner pub in St. Paul for 5 hours having a rowdy good time. It slowed me down on Sunday though. We had to finish the programs so we went back to the parent's house to finish 'em up. I spent most of my time working on the programs and doing our laundry (god bless parents with washing machines) while Courtney did every imaginable task for the wedding. I seriously thought we had more done than what we had. There was so much to do on Sunday and all I felt like doing was belly-aching.<br>

				<div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><br><br>				<b>2002-01-11 11:50:29 - 7 days until marriage</b>
				<hr size="2" noshade>
				It didn't truly hit me until I exchanged some emails with Johnny C. yesterday that there are a fair amount of people curious about the whole wedding thing and what goes into it. More specifically, what the last week of singlehood is like before the wedding. In an effort to take on this documentaryesque task I shall increase the amount I post to track my thoughts each day in a false belief that people are actually interested. When in fact, writing will help calm my nerves which are starting to hit a feverish high.<br><br>
Just today my stomach has started rumbling. And not the good type of rambling. It's one of two things with me. It's either the nervousness of everything has started finally taking a physical hit against my body, the Mint Condition from Caribou Coffee is not settling right, or I'm getting sick. If I am truly getting sick I wouldn't be surprised. Since early December there has been some very disgusting colds going around. This fall I have proudly touted that I never get sick. It has been quite a while since I've had a full-blown attack of the flu or anything else which puts me flat on my back. And ever since Courtney warned me against such boastings I've been taking vitamins like a hypocontriac. Getting sick is my worst fear of all. Being sick on a wedding day is not how I want things to go. The pictures will turn out lousy. I'll be no fun. Plus it's not the right way to start a honeymoon. So if you were to ask me what I'm most nervous about, that's it. Getting sick. <br><br><br>

				<div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><br><br>				<b>2002-01-09 21:54:55 - My First Filling</b>
				<hr size="2" noshade>
				Here's an email I sent my parents today that I figured everyone would enjoy:<br><br>

I'm waiting for some processing to finish at work so I thought I would
tell you about my trip to the dentist this morning.
<br><br>
When the hygenist brought me back to the chair she mentioned that the
doctor would be a long shortly.  It was a good thing I was early, she
said, because the doctor finished early on another patient. While she's
telling me all this I kept thinking, "I just came for a cleaning! What are
they talking about!" So when the dentist showed up she started explaining
what they were going to do to me and such.It quickly became apparent that
what I assumed was my followup cleaning has turned into my first
experience with a filling.
<br><br>
The doctor was quite nice and told me to just raise my left hand if I feel
anything. SO  about 10 seconds into the drilling I feel this sharp pain in
                        

my tooth. I raise my hand and they get me more novicaine. I tell them I'm
a big boy and I promise not to do that again. 10 more seconds I feel
another shooting pain through my tooth. They get me more. After 3 shots of
novicaine they could have drilled straight into the nerve and I don't
think I would have felt a thing. After that it was painless, literally.
But because of all the pain meds I will be unable to drink for a while and
she told me to just forget about eating today.
<br><br>
What have I learning from this experience? Never stop going to the dentist
for 5 years. And that the shots are nothing to worry about, at least at a
Health Partners clinic.

				<div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><br><br>				<b>2001-12-31 04:44:47 - Ye Ol' Christmas Update</b>
				<hr size="2" noshade>
				It's now becoming a ritual for me to do a Christmas update with all the cool stuff I got. So here it goes for 2001.<br><br>
It turns out having an Amazon wishlist paid off this year. I got practically everything on my list except for the Akira graphic novels. Here's just a portion of the cool stuff I got:<br>
<br>
1. Wide-angle camera lense<br>
2. The Sixth Sense DVD (Wow!)<br>
3. Dropkick Murphys CD<br>
4. Whole ton of books<br>
5. Couple of sweet shirts for work<br>
6. A very nice and professional atache for work. I think it's called an atache.<br>
<br>
So that's that. Christmas has gone by quickly. The wedding is now imminent. We are now spending all our free time doing wedding stuff. We are currently working on the programs which may turn out to be the most time consuming of all our projects. I'm a little concerned about the honeymoon. All we have gotten from the travel agency is an itinerary. I think that's all we need. I hope there isn't any more.<br><br>
Oh yes, by the way, the RSVP thing. Right, yeah, so we sent you all RSVP cards for a reason. Use them. The deadline is January 2nd. No RSVP, no dinner. We sent out 175 invitations and have seen a sliver of RSVPs returned and it's quite annoying. Just off the top of our head we have been able to count 40 people who did not return RSVPs who we know are going to be at the reception. We're seriously concerned about those who we don't know are going to show up. It's gonna be a good dinner too. I wouldn't miss it if I were you.<br>

				<div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><br><br>				<b>2001-12-20 15:48:46 - Simmer down</b>
				<hr size="2" noshade>
				Whoa! Where did December go? Between the wedding, Vegas, Christmas, computers, and the dentist I haven't had time to think. So let me recap what's been going on in my life.<br><br>
<b>Wedding</b><br>
Although there are a ton of outstanding issues everything seems to be falling into place. The big thing I have left to do is write my vows. I keep promising Courtney I'll do it. One of these nights I actually will. For the second time our honeymoon got a little derailed. Not as bad and before though. We were flying on Sun Country until they decided to close up shop. Now we have to take a flight back at 11:40pm Sunday night which is less than ideal.<br><br>
<b>Las Vegas</b><br>
Las Vegas was everything I thought it was going to be. And I'm never going back again. Well, at least not for many, many years. The trip was best summed up by Grant at 12:30am Friday night when we were trying to find a bite to eat. We had been there for 16 hours and Grant declared to everyone in a very low, shaky voice, "I am a delicate flower." We peaked high and quick and from there on out it was all down hill. Vegas has too many lights and too much noise. It's a sensory overload. I can say honestly if I never see Carrot Top again I'll be a happy man.<br><br>
<b>Christmas</b><br>
Christmas has really snuck up on me this year. We finished our shopping early 'cept for Courtney's dad. Though Courtney's brother said he had it all taken care of. All we had to do was kick in some dough. But I haven't heard from him lately so if you're out there, Chad, I think you know my email address. I went to the jewelers (again!) to see if I could find Courtney anything interesting for Christmas. We promised not to go all out like we traditionally do. Neither one of us have much money to be throwing around. So I wanted something cheap. Well, I couldn't bare to have my darling wearing anything cheap so I picked her up a nice pearl necklace and earrings. You know, for the wedding and all. I couldn't keep a secret so I gave them to her that same night. Now I wish I hadn't cuz I won't be able to top that with a cheesy Christmas present.<br><br>
<b>Computers</b><br>
The week before Vegas my computer decided it was going to give up. It basically stopped functioning all together. The hard drives started spouting loud profanities at me so I decided to finally put it in its final resting place and build a new one. I wasn't able to go all out like I had hoped but for $450 bucks I was able to build a pretty decent machine. 512 megs ram, AMD Athlon 1700+, a new motherboard and case have turned me back into the hardcore computer elitest that I love to be. Feel free to envy me.<br><br>
<b>Dentist</b><br>
You may be asking why this was such a big deal, right? I haven't been to the dentist in 5 years. Of all things my parents made me do, the dentist is what I feared most. This topped off with a tooth ache that was starting to throb had me scared shitless for two months. That's how long I had to wait for an appointment. I ( and by "I" I mean Courtney) made the appointment back in October. I mustered up enough courage to go this morning and after all was said and done, the Doc told me I have great teeth.....except for the gaping crack in my back tooth. So it wasn't so bad I guess. It could have been worse. They did say the crack was probably from me gritting my teeth. So no more caffiene or stress for Jason! Yeah, right.<br>
