              My latest Internet fascination has been with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.bbsmates.com/">BBSMates.com</a> which allows you to find old friends from the BBS days. Granted, I was 12-17 when I BBS'd so I didn't have any real online friends but it's still sweet to remember all the aliases from the boards. I registered with The Hub, Death Cookie, and a few others (including SOLAT). But I was surprised to not find Vanilla Fudge's The Chalet or Kirk's old board. For the life of me I can't think of his BBS's name. His handle was Chip so I want to say it was something like Chips and Dips. Bah, that was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.slashdot.org/">/.</a>'s old name. Well, if you happen to know Kirk and what I'm talking about please let him know I'm looking for his BBS name.<br>

              Holy crap, I just realized that I'm completed bummed out. Maybe it's today, maybe it's work, maybe it's the weather. My favorite Soul Coughing song just came on. Maybe that will cheer me up.

              I must have turned my spam filtering software onto "anal retentive" because it has been blocking all email sent to me from free mail services, including email I was supposed to get. So my poor grandmas are probably pretty irked about me not writing them back. hehe.... But it would also explain messages like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.computerjargon.com/comment.phtml?cid=305">this</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.computerjargon.com/comment.phtml?cid=307">this</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.computerjargon.com/comment.phtml?cid=306">this</a>. Whoops! Well, at least I'm no longer on the Domain Blocked List for open email relays. So not only was I blocking legit email, my server was also relaying spam which put me on many, many <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://relays.osirusoft.com/">shitlists</a>.  <br>

              We didn't do too much this past weekend. Friday night was spent at Heather's brother's wedding. Saturday we made the voyage to Krispy Kreme. I discovered the carmel apple doughnut which quickly became my all-time favorite doughnut. Most of the day Saturday was spent cleaning house or trying to avoid it at all costs. Saturday night we hit Sawatdee in Maple Grove after Rick had tipped me off about it. It was a little different than the few in Minneapolis. For one their spice ranks are WAY off. I ordered by usual chicken Pad Thai at a 3 spicy level. I had to stop eating it after a few bites due to my runny nose and watery eyes. Whew, those white boys in Maple Grove can sure make some spicy thai food. After dinner we saw <b>One Hour Photo</b> which hit the spot. Not too creepy but enough off of mainstream that it kept my interest for the entire film. I would suggest most people see it. Beware though, this recommendation comes from the guy who saw the Blair Witch Project twice in the theaters. I mowed the grass on Sunday and chased the dogs around with the mower. I finished up ALL the laundry. Yes, ALL of it. Even the stuff that's been on the floor since we moved in.<br><br>
So yes, another eventful weekend spent avoiding painting the house. We are becoming very cleaver at avoiding all fix 'em up projects. Buying dogs, eating doughnuts, all things done to assure we stay too busy to do the hard work. So what am I doing tonight to avoid painting? Well, it appears our bathtub drain has clogged So I'm going to spend a few minutes/hours with a drain augger trying to clear it out.<br><br>
Apparently Sony doesn't want the new Pearl Jam cd to be bootlegged before it's release in November so they have sent out review copies in a Sony walkman which is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://slashdot.org/articles/02/09/16/0647232.shtml?tid=141">glued shut</a>. I wonder if the EULA for the discwill require me to glue shut any player I play the CD in?<br>

              I'm not one to be sentimental, and honestly I think the media smoothering of today is sickening, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.puckwucker.com/">Courtney</a> passed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.freep.com/news/metro/mitch11_20020911.htm">this</a> onto me and it's quite good. <br>

              Ah, has it been an entire month since my last post? Wowsers. No wonder <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.google.com/">Google</a> doesn't pick up my site. Did you know that if you do a search for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=%22jason+motylinski%22">Jason Motylinski</a> on Google this site isn't returned? Hell, even a quote of mine, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.flexible-unternehmen.de/fb990121.htm">TRANSLATED into German</a>, makes the list. <br><br>
What's new you ask? Well, destruction of our house continues. We're moving slowly but surely with our rennovations. Last weekend I took a few minutes to fix our deck stairs. Yep, I would do the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.knology.net/~carlos/redneck.htm">redneck neighbor</a> proud. I'm so happy with the stair-enhancement that I'll be posting some pictures of it shortly. <br><br>
We picked up another dog, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.computerjargon.com/gallery/album26">Dottie</a>. She's a five year old Great Dane and has the heart of a saint. For such a large dog she wouldn't hurt fly.<br><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020924124300/http://www.chadangerer.com/">Chad</a> and I have made it our mission to become regulars at the BW3s in Crystal. I'm glad to report that last week our mission was completed as we now have most waiters/waitresses knowing us. It's nice to be wanted.<br>
