<center><b>Welcome to Computer Jargon!</b></center><br><b>2000-03-02 - Get back in the arms</b><br>Alright, after NUMEROUS comments regarding the abysmal way my apartment looks, I am going to clean it. I hope you all are happy now. I know Courtney will appreciate all the harsh comments. ;)<br><br>
Work is picking up again. I'm ramping up to launch another site. This time it's West Palm Beach in Florida. Unfortuneately I still haven't visited any of the sites I have worked on. I would really like to visit the towns and stations just to say hi and get a feel for what they do.<br><br>
I came up with the greatest idea this week. I'm going to rip all my CDs to MP3 and replace my CD player stereo component with a line from my computer. Wahoo! I have the 40gig hard drive on order. Someone suggested tape backup. I'm thinking it would be a good idea. I calculated that I would need roughly 22-25 gigs to rip what I have now. I figured in 450 CDs that are on average 50 minutes long. MP3 is rough a meg a minute so 40 gigs should do me fine. In the end I would like to write a Gnome frontend for it. I'll probably end up using Bojay's MP3 databasing tool too to catalog all the files.<br>[<a href="comment.php?writecomment=1&amp;jid=20">Post a comment</a>]<br><br><div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><b>2000-02-27 - Webcam is Back!!</b><br>WAHOO!!! The webcam is back. Unfortuneately it isn't the workcam...it's the Complex Cam! That's right, it's me in all my glory at home! Check it out at: <b><a href="webcam.shtml">http://www.computerjargon.com/webcam.shtml</a></b>.<br>[<a href="comment.php?writecomment=1&amp;jid=19">Post a comment</a>]<br><br><div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><b>2000-02-17 - Snow</b><br>I hate snow. I really do. It has been snowing all week in MN and I'm sick of it. I love Minnesota but quite honestly the weather sucks. <br><br>
Hmm, what's new....My valentine's day was entertaining to say the least. I upgraded the RAM in my computer to 192 megs. I filed my taxes....<br><br>
Here's an interesting warning: Do not buy TurboTax from Quicken. Get this, first you buy the software from Best Buy or your local computer retailer. You pay 30 bucks to ease the pain of taxes. You then must pay to file your taxes electronically, another $10. Then you are informed that you need to purchase your local state version of TurboTax to do your state taxes, add $30. PLUS another $10 to file your state taxes electronically. Yes, I hate doing taxes. Yes, they are confusing. But what makes them think I'm going to spend my tax return on tax software? I was guillible enough to buy the TurboTax software but after I started adding it all up I felt like an idiot. <br><br>
Problem: I hate doing taxes and I get confused by my taxes.<br>
Solution: Use TurboTax.com and do them online<br>
This is a great solution to those who want an easy way to file taxes. Not everyone can use the online application for filing but I highly suggest it. For us who are not rich (yet) it's quick and painless. After forking out $20 to file my taxes I was done and it was all over. Yeah!
<br>[<a href="comment.php?writecomment=1&amp;jid=18">Post a comment</a>]<br><br><div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><b>2000-02-09 - Burnt</b><br>Okay, I'll admit it now, I'm burnt out. I'm sitting here in front of my computer and I don't even want to look at this stupid thing. I don't want to use it, I don't want to play with it, I don't even want it on. I just want it to go away. In fact, I feel like throwing it across the room.
<br><br>
I need a counter. But I don't want to code one. I have one done in perl, and I like it mind you, but I just don't want to take the time to get it working. I just don't care. I don't want to DO anything. I just want to stare at a blank wall and not think. I want to stop thinking. <br>[<a href="comment.php?writecomment=1&amp;jid=17">Post a comment</a>]<br><br><div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><b>2000-02-04 - Wahoo!!</b><br>Wahoo! 18 days of uptime! This is my personal best. I'm shooting for 40 days without a linux reboot. But if I buy more RAM I just may have to shutdown. I'll try and fight the urge for more RAM. I hope I can do it...:)<br><br>
Work has been stressful to say the least. I'm starting to question the respect I've been working so hard to gain. I don't think it's genuine. I guess we'll find out at review time.
