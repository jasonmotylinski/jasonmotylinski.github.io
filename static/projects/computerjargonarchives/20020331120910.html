				My favorite search engine keyword this month is:<br>
<b>underwear pics from the movie crossroads</b><br><br>
I'm sorry, perverts, but none of that here. But thanks for stopping.<br>

				<div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><br><br>				<b>2002-03-21 06:42:41 - What a birthday present</b>
				<hr size="2" noshade>
				Yesterday, the 20th, was my birthday. I have realized that 24 is the year you start feeling old. Comments have gone from, "Boy, you are so young," to "Wow, you're gettin' up there. As I explained to Courtney last night, 21 is finally coming of age. 22, you wonder where 21 went. At 23 you start to question how fast time flies. By 24 it's all over. I'm officially old.<br><br>
I like to get gifts. So I woke Court up on my birthday to hassle her about what she got me. I had dropped a few hints (blantant comments) about what I wanted. She reminded me of what I got her for her last birthday: nothing. So I felt quite guilty BUT Courtney still came through. I got this:<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910im_/http://www.satellitetheater.com/_borders/rmav2100.gif"><br>
Yes, that's right. I got the most ridiculous remote control EVER. And you know what? It ACTUALLY solves my 4 remote control problem. I've bought 3 different universal remotes trying to reduce the amount of remotes I have. They only increased the urgency of finding a solution.<br>

				I released a C# demo on how to read an ID3v2 tag from an mp3 file. I'm quite frustrated that no one has written a reader/writer yet. I only wrote a bare bones reader just to demo how to do it. Nonetheless, it's over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.brokenindustries.com/">Broken Industries</a> if you are curious.<br>

				<div class="comments"><ul></ul></div><br><br>				<b>2002-03-18 21:31:00 - Secret addiction</b>
				<hr size="2" noshade>
				I hate to admit it but my latest secret addiction has been <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.elimidate.com/">Elimidate</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.shipmatestv.com/">Shipmates</a>. Yeah, I know, it's a trashy habit. But I really hate to miss them. It's probably more of a conpulsion than an addiction. Now that I've gotten in the rut of watching them at 9pm each night I'd hate to break that habit.<br><br>
I spent the weekend wrestling with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.turbotax.com/">TurboTax.com</a>. I have discovered that Minnesota's tax rules are much tighter than I was expecting. My tax return was rejected 3 times due to a date being wrong. It was the date that I said they could take the money OUT of my checking account. OUT! They didn't want to take my money! (Please refer to how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.computerjargon.com/images/galleries/interestingfriends/pope.jpg">Joe H.</a> yells about things for the next sentence.) "I was giving them my money! I said, 'TAKE IT!' and they wouldn't take it! What the hell!"<br><br>
If you happen to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.computerjargon.com/archive.phtml?action=displayjournal&amp;qid=228">remember</a> I have a few boundries that I like to keep with coworkers. And when coworkers cross those boundries I get quite frustrated. Today someone crossed the line and I had a hard time dealing with it. Even with friends I tend to keep a fair amount of distance between ourselves. But this guy got all up in my face when talking to me. I need two feet people! Two feet around me! Unless I've known you for 4+ years. And there are only two exceptions to that rule: Rico and Mitch. The rest of you, who I hardly know, two feet. Remember that. And if you make comments about how easy it is to "kipe" my wallet, I'll think you're hitting on me. So, let's review:<br><br>
<b>Jason's Rule to Social Space</b><br>
1. At least 2 feet, at a minimum between you and I at all times.<br>
2. The only exemptions to this are friendships over 4+ years, Rico, and Mitch.<br>
3. Don't talk about my wallet. Yes, I know it's big<br>
4. If you talk about my wallet I will get pissed because you are looking at my ass.<br>
5. If you talk about my wallet I will assume you are hitting on me.<br>

				Woohoo! Today I released my C#.NET bulletin board code over on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.brokenindustries.com/">Broken Industries</a>. If you have no idea what I'm talking about check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.computerjargon.com:10678/BulletinBoard/">bulletin board</a>. I absolutely hate writing manuals and submitting code. I just post the stuff to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.brokenindustries.com/">Broken Industries</a> so I feel like I've made my contribution to the open source community.<br>

				<hr size="2" noshade>
				Alright, I'll admit it. I've forgotten about my own website. I've been busy with everyone else's website that I managed to forget to update my own content. Actually, I've been swept up with Microsoft's .NET that I haven't really been developing any web projects lately, just Windows applications. I did manage to create an ID3v2 reader in C# which hasn't existed until I wrote it. <br><br>
The tiny amount of work I have done has been on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.boneclub.com/">Boneclub.com</a> which I was able to procure after 5 years of waiting. I promptly turned it over to Andrew, the rightful owner of the domain name. There's not much there except for the images. Andrew cruised by 3 weeks ago and we scanned in a couple of images. <br><br>
Court and I got the itch to see a movie this weekend. There is utter crap out at the theaters right now. Southdale did have a showing of the <b>Royal Tenenbaums</b> so we took a stab at it. It was what I expected, the sort of jokes you feel bad for laughing at because they are so dark. Nonetheless I would recommend it to most people except my parents. <br><br>
My birthday is on March 20th and I want a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020331120910/http://www.marine-monsters.com/front/products/bitchar-g.html">Bit Char-G</a>. EVERYONE has one except for me. I'm going to be the only dork in a pool of geeks.<br><br>
I finally finished selling of my Simpsons toys. After all the hassle with EBay I would have rather just thrown them out. Although I did make 450 bucks on the deal which isn't too bad. I had to refund a lady her entire order because she was upset with the quality of the product I sent her. Unbeknownst to me the screws on the playset were stripped! Can you imagine! STRIPPED! A toy isn't mint if the screws are stripped! Sheesh! I felt bad because, honestly, when I bought the playset I had my suspicions about the mint quality of it.<br><br>
