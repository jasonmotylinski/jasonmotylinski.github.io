        I was informed this morning that the Pixies have once again joined forces to battle against the forces of unoriginal, corporate rock. To my dismay, though, I was three weeks late in getting tickets for their show in the cities. Dang. I am really bent out of shape about missing this show. Hopefully if the tour goes well they will swing back in to town.<br>

        I just woke up to the song <b>Land of Confusion</b> by <b>Genesis</b> pounding in my head. Thank god for iTunes. The single will have to hold me over until I can get to Best Buy for the entire <b>Invisible Touch</b> album (circa '86). I have my uncle Mark to thank for my Genesis/Phil Collins appreciation.<br><br>
Today is my 26th birthday. It's a bittersweet birthday for a few reasons. I never planned by life beyond 25. When I was 16 I never thought past 25. I figured one of two things would happen (and don't freak out Mom and Dad, I was 16): 1. I wouldn't make it past 25 so there was nothing to worry about or 2. I would figure it out by the time I was 26 and know exactly what to do. Well, guess what? I didn't figure it out and I'm still here. So I'm stuck not quite knowing what to do for my 26th birthday. When I was 16 being 25 seemed so old. I figured I wouldn't have to worry about anything beyond it. Hmm. Nice thoughts for my birthday, eh?<br><br>
Bah, this <b>Land of Confusion</b> copy sucks from iTunes. I'll have to go get the album itself. <br>

        I was a little vocal about my displeasure about the movie <b>The Passion of the Christ</b> and Mel Gibson's seemingly endless ego about making it. But my curiosity got the better of me and I found myself in line Sunday to see it.<br><br>
After viewing <b>The Passion</b> I can honestly say that all my comments about Gibson's righteousness and pretentiousness were dead on. I'm not a religious person by any stretch of the imagination but it seemed very arrogant of Gibson to make such a movie in such a way. I think I'm mostly concerned that Gibson felt he could make the fifth gospel, which is what the movie is portrayed as. And also that people will begin to believe that the truth is a Hollywood media frenzy, and not the bible. <br><br>

Not that I care much, I just don't like gullible people.<br><br>
BTW, don't forget to pick up any of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040402144647/http://www.sharethepassionofthechrist.com/">offically licensed merchandise</a>. Chances are it will bring you closer to God.<br>

        One day I will write a book about home servicemen repair. Or at least create a website for them.<br><br>
Our fridge has been on the fritz for probably two months. We didn't notice for a month because we didn't have any food in it. We finally did start to wonder if something was wrong when our ice cream wouldn't freeze. We tried cleaning out the coils, which did help a bit. But the fridge never really got as cold as it should. So what did I do? I called Sears.<br><br>
30 seconds and 65 bucks later the guy tells me I need a new fridge. "Compressor's shot," is what he really said. He said this after taking 3 steps into my house. He did open up a back panel to give it a glance, but I think he did that to rationalize the tab he was about to stick me with.<br><br>
The biggest pain about replacing our fridge will be finding one the exact size we need. When we moved in the fridge wasn't under the cabinets like in most homes. It was off to the side of our kitchen counter, in an inconvienent place. We wanted to put it underneath our cabinet but it required us to shave part of our cabinets away. So now we have a very tight spot for a 66-inch by 29-inch refrigerator to fit. Anything larger just ain't gonna work. <br>

        Well, the new DSL speed increase happened this morning sometime between my shower and getting to work. I can't really tell much of a difference from work though. My line should handle 1.5mbit down /1mbit up but I'm getting somewhere around 970kbit down / 400kbit up. Still a two-fold increase from my line before. I'm just at a loss as to what to download first. :-) <br><br>
<b>UPDATE:</b> Last night I was able to max out both my download and upload pipe. All is well in the Motylinski compound.<br>
