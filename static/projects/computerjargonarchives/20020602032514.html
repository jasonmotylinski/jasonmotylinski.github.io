              I had a decent weekend. It seemed to pass in a blur though. Saturday morning Courtney and I got up and made the trek to Krispy Kreme in Maple Grove. Surprisingly there was a line out the door and cops patrolling traffic. I'll hand it to the Krispy Kreme folks though, they handled the traffic well. My initial plan was to just get 1 or 2 doughnuts. But after waiting 20 minutes I felt I had earned a dozen or so. Needless to say, they were all gone by Monday morning with the exception of a blueberry filled powdered doughnut, which I won't eat. We then swung down to the Mall of America where we did some shopping. Courtney cut her hair last week so we had to find some new hair accessories. We managed to snake our way into Suncoast where Courtney scored me a copy of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020602032514/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/079284405X/qid=1021294381/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-2474774-6083331">Shallow Grave</a>. I believe it's Ewan McGregor's first movie. I have a Trainspotting poster in the apartment. For 4 years I've been starring at it, reading the line "From the makers of Shallow Grave." It had become an itch that needed to be scratched. I was becoming obsessed with finding the movie. So many thanks to my wife for curing me of my movie ails. Yes, it's a great movie. I was impressed with it, very creepy though. Sunday was filled with mom stuff. Thanks to Joe for the kind reminder of Mother's Day. <br><br>
Joe brings me to another topic, house hunting. Just a friendly point which no one informed me of: When you start house-hunting, dive in and be serious about it. Otherwise you'll end up watching a lot of houses fly off the market before you even get a chance to look at them. As Courtney pointed out, I've finally found a sense of urgency to this house-hunting stuff after watching a couple of houses we were interested in go off the market. So our next stab it is tomorrow. Yea!<br><br>
I think in the past week I've picked up 4 or 5 new albums. Joe Strummer, a couple New Found Glory albums --- nothing I really like though. Although I did find a few new mp3s I dig.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020602032514/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004X0ER/qid=1021295062/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/102-2474774-6083331">The Hives</a> have that old-school punk/New York sound I'm so hot for lately. <br>

              Courtney and I made it to an early showing of Spider-Man on Saturday. Maybe I'm being too picky but it definitely felt like a Sam Raimi film. If you've ever experienced the Evil Dead series you'd understand. Spider-Man seemed to have an abundance of flying skulls in it. Which is fine, I guess. It just didn't seem to fit with film. Other than that it simply rocked. I appreciated the fairly-close-to-real comic book story. I don't believe the real Spiderman could shoot web from his wrists. If I remember correctly, I believe Parker built the web shooters. Feel free to prove me wrong. Toby Maguire was perfect for the roll. The E! Spider-Man special listed Leonardo and Freddy Prinze as other possible candidates. Neither would have worked as well as Maguire. I could have done without Kirsten Dunst. Anyone could have played Mary Jane. I don't think she deserves the accolades she's getting. Now, just two weeks until Star Wars. Woohoo! I'm lookin' forward to another Ewan McGregor movie.

              Yum. Janet brought in Krispy Kremes to work today. It just made my day and she's gained a new best friend. :-) Court and I must make the trek to Maple Grove one of these weekends for a Krispy Kreme. Rumor around the watering hole is that the craziness still hasn't died down since it opened 2 weeks ago. <br>
Yum.<br><br>

              We took the plunge this weekend and ordered cable television. We haven't had cable for 2-3 years. Back in the day I felt it was a waste of money since all I watched was Fox anyway. But it seems the quality of television programming has increased dramatically. Or I've just gotten desparate for good television after getting ill watching NASCAR on Sunday afternoons. Nevertheless, we now have 70 channels of pure bliss entertainment.<br><br>
The installation was surprisingly painless. The hardest part was finding the number to Time Warner cable. Once I had procured it, I gave them a ring and shouted, "I WANT MY MTV!" The man on the other end had obviously heard that one before and wasn't too amused. Anyway, after five minutes of giving them my information I asked when could I get it installed. The operator told me he'd turn it on right now. YIKES! And just like that, we were back in the 21st century.<br><br>
I did have some ulterior motives to cable, though. I wanted to goof around with the PVR (personal video recorder) idea. You know, Tivo, UltimateTV, but better. Those components are great but there's no way to offload the shows. What if I really liked an episode of King of the Hill? How would I save it? So I investigated the computer card options. Most solutions range from $200 to $300, which seemed like no deal over buying a Tivo. But then I did find a affordable, oh heck down right cheap, card at CompUSA for $40 with all the software I needed. I raced out during the snow storm on Sunday and got one of these <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020602032514/http://techsupport.iomagic.com/support/videocards/PCPVR/index.htm">buggers</a>. It's great, I can record shows to VCD format, ready to burn off and archive. No longer will I ever miss another Real World/Road Rules Challenge! Or the Justice League! Woohoo!<br><br>
An interesting sidenote: It seems <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020602032514/http://aron.braggans.com/">Mr. Braggans</a> had the same idea although I believe he's setting up a dedicated machine to be the PVR.<br>

              I have seen the light, and it is good. I now understand how one can love a <b>George Forman Grill</b>. After spending years (okay, probably months) frying my chicken in a pan I finally tried what I affectionately call the Forman. It has changed my life. Pushing my luck with "As Seen on TV" merchandise, I picked up a <b>Quick Chopper</b> yesterday. The results were not as good as the Forman experience, but it worked out nicely. It is definitely easier to use than our huge food processor.<br><br>
I like the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020602032514/http://www.whitestripes.com/">White Stripes</a>. You may not.<br>
<br>
Also, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020602032514/http://www.computerjargon.com/comment.phtml?cid=276">this comment</a> sort of bothered me. Wouldn't you get ON the medication to get better? The logic just seems backwards. They were from Australia, which answers a few questions.<br><br>
I waited a month for another Bit Char-g from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020602032514/http://www.marine-monsters.com/">Marine Monsters</a>. I finally cancelled it and I'm now looking for a new Bit Char-g vendor. Feel free to leave your suggestions.<br>

              If there is one Pearl Jam song I hate it would have to be <b>Dissident</b>. I think it has something to do with a candied peanut and trip to Duluth experience from my younger days.<br><br>
This weekend aims to be lowkey with some quality time with Courtney. it's been another whirlwind past couple of weeks with birthdays, deaths, and Easter. So if I can get some down time this weekend I'll be quite happy.<br><br>
Nothing much new is going on. If you haven't caught MTV's <b>The Osbournes</b> yet you're missing out. Since I don't have cable I have to beg people at work to tape them for me. Pathetic, yes, but it's worth the self-humiliation.<br><br>
I pinpointed Nirvana as the sole reason I began playing the guitar. I caught their <b>Unplugged</b> the other night on MTV2 and I magnetically drawn to pick up my guitar that hasn't been strummed in 2 years. I think the Nirvana connection may be due to the simplicity of all their music.<br><br><br>
