        Court and I are going camping this weekend with Chad and Tina. It should be a good time. Have I ever mentioned though that I can count the amount of times I've been camping in my life on one hand? So you can only imagine just how handy I am when it comes to starting fires, cutting trees, and doing the typical camping stuff. We went out and bought a rediculously large 3-room tent for the trip. I set up in the back yard to test it out and couldn't stopping giggling about the size. I did discover though that our larger dog is not a fan of the tent. She spent the few minutes she was in the tent running into the walls trying to get out. I also managed to whip myself across the chin with one of the structure bars. I don't think it'll bruise. <br>

        Yeah, well, you can't tell me your life has been any more exciting than mine. If you think so, go ahead and start weblogging yourself. :)<br><br>
I've started studying for certification in .Net. At first it was out of purely selfish reasons. A co-worker had taken one of the 3 tests necessary for certification. Needing to keep up with the Jones', I started down the path. But then work introduced a certification incentive program to get certified in a timely manor. The only downside is it needs to be done by October. To get a Microsoft MCAD certification you must take 3 tests. That means I need to take a test a month. Which means I need to read 1 700 page book a month, take 3 to 4 practice tests, join a study group, and basically have my life revolve around passing this thing for the next 3 months. All on top of needing to be productive at work. Yeah, right... Regardless of the October deadline the company will still reimburse for passed tests. One interesting thing I think my company fails to realize is that developers typically are not driven by money. You cannot motivate developers to do things by offering them money. What started most of us down the cert path? Jealousy of another developer and having the feeling that we're falling behind.<br>

Mitch had to drag me there, tooth and nail. He even had to buy me a ticket. I've never been a fan of arena rock or the bands that play it. But Pearl Jam, well, is Pearl Jam. Even with that said I still refused to believe that even a band of their caliber could pull off a good show with 10,000 screaming fans. <br><br>
But they did.<br><br>
And I'm glad I went.<br><br><br>

        3:43 am - And what's the status of your company's web servers? I can guarantee that ours are fine.....because I'm f'in' awake to check them!<br><br>
For the love of God, if you are going to have a pager which alerts you of problems on your servers, at least let there be a problem!<br><br>
3:44 am - Server check. Appears to be fine<br><br>
3:45 am - Server check. All quiet on the home front.<br><br>
3:46 am - Bathroom break. Server watching has be all worked up.<br><br>
3:47 am - Server check. *yawn*<br><br>
3:48 am - God dang, what was that hot idea I told Chad about? Something about a picture on my web site.<br><br>
3:49 am - Server check. I'm so hung over.<br><br>
3:50 am - Screw this. I'm going to bed.<br>

        After watching a VH1 Behind the Music about AC/DC I have rediscovered the wonder that is good ol' Jock Rock.<br><br>
I've been seeking some sort of alternative escape from reality lately. My wife always warned me about getting to deep into one thing and drowning. I now find myself seeking new things, new thoughts, to try and cleanse the old thoughts. So I've taken to exploring not only new technologies but also things which help me focus more creatively in other aspects in my life. For the first time in 4 years I'm picking up a guitar again. I'm planting grass seed. The ironic part is I'm alergic to pollen. So planting seed causes me to sneeze uncontrollably for 2 hours afterwards. But it's a simple task which requires no brain power. I don't have to think. And it's a relief. I don't have to think about people. I don't have to think about anyone. I don't have to think about me. It's a simple, mindless task that gives me a smile every time I do it.<br>
