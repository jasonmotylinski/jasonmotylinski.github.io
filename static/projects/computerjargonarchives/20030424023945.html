        Saturday Courtney and I ventured out into the shopping world. We didn't have much to spend but we did have a mission. Courtney needed a new dress for a wedding and I needed my Mike Doughty tickets. Since the tickets weren't on sale until noon we beebopped around Ridgedale mall for a couple hours. At 5 past noon we meandered over to the Ticketbastered outlet to pick up some tickets. The lady at the counter asked abruptly for which show we wanted tickets, I told her, and she handed me 2 tickets for row D, 4 rows from the front. PERFECT. I was on cloud 9....until she corrected herself and said, "Row D, in the balcony." WTF?! I had a hard time believing this was the concert of the century and all the good floor tickets had already sold out. After bitching a bit she sniped, "Well that's just how fast they go." The second ticketer leaned over and mentioned that even though the tickets went on sale at noon she had just sold a pair 20 minutes earlier. Doing the math.....Someone wasn't following the rules. Boy did it really cook my goose.<br><br>
So, to get me back in a better mood we continued shopping. We ended up bouncing from Ridgedale to Southdale when Ann Taylor was out of a dress. It was on to the MOA for some shoe shopping. We stopped in at Claire's so Courtney could find some earrings and a bracelet. Anyone who has ever glanced into a Claire's knows there's at least 30 people shorter than 4 feet in the store at any given time. It was a madhouse as usual. As we stood in the single line for checkout a second register opened up. The line wasn't abnormally long, but there were a fair amount of us waiting to check out. A mother walks up to the second register, glances around, and basically hops the line. TWICE! Twice in one day had someone pissed on my parade! I scoffed and fidgeted nervously while I tried to get up the nerve to call her a really rude name. But then I realized I would be no better than her. So I just cursed under my breath.<br>

        I get roughly 50 to 80 pieces of spam a day. My spam catcher catches a majority of them but typically 10 to 20 slip through.<br><br>
My wife got me thinking the other day, ss it fair for me to go to a wedding if the person didn't come to mine? I'm not saying that I'm not going, Courtney. I'm just throwing out the thought.<br><br>
I've been sleeping absolutely horridly lately. Partially due to the war. I've been having a ton of air raid dreams. Partially due to work and the stress I'm under. And part due to my frequent trips to BW3s. I'm sure if I would have a healthier diet I wouldn't be woken up in a sweat in the middle of the night.<br><br>
In the past year my car insurance has been cut in half because of my wife, the house, and turning 25. <br><br>
Well, that's enough random thoughts for now.<br>

        My grandma taught me something last time I was at her house a few months ago. She showed me the difference between a teflon coated clothing iron and a stainless steel iron. 4 years ago I purchased a teflon coated iron, which served it's purpose. But as of late a mysterious gunk started forming on the bottom of it. For the most part the gunk didn't harm the ironed clothes. But last week the gunk started coming off. I went to iron a brand new shirt and I streaked it with this black goo. So I purchased a new stainless steel iron last night. It's a dream come true. If you are looking for an iron, spend the extra few bucks to get the good one. Thank you, grandma.<br><br>
Last night Chad, Leon, and I attempted to frequent the local BW3s. We should have known something was wrong when we couldn't find any of the regular servers. Chris, Ryan, Mike, Hank were nowhere to be found. Then, the karaoke guy showed up. It was all down hill from there. We were inconveniently seated right in front of the make-shift karaoke stage with a big bald man forcing us to move our table impeading in other tables' space. So we were crammed in at the bar, with blaring music, and a lousy, lousy waitstaff. Shame on you BW3s. I shall never go there again....on Wednesdays.<br>

        Well, Chuck E. Cheese was a bust for the most part. I insisted on going there for my birthday with the family. Apparently they've removed all their video games in favor of physical activities for children. Which is good for the kids of today, to get a little exercise. I should have suggested Gameworks in downtown. Then we would have been assured a good time. Although I must say I think the experience was worth it to almost get beaten by an 8 eight year old in auto racing and the Vanilla Coke dispenser. It did make my day. My lovely parents also managed to get me a birthday cookie, just like I had asked. Yes, I will be 25, not 12. I figure birthdays are for oddball requests and weird situations. If I didn't have that, what good would a birthday be?<br><br><br>
