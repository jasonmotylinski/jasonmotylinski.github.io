								<b>2001-05-13 09:22:24 - Do it Doughty Style</b>
				<hr size="2" noshade>
				Ok, all my whining and crying paid off. Courtney and I did get to see Mike Doughty last night. It was fabulous. For some reason the Minnesota scene has accepted Soul Coughing/Mike Doughty into it's inner circle. The crowd was unusually kind to Mike. He did some serious ass kicking too. I now am in the know with Firetruck. Nice to see Joe made it too even without his friend in rehab.<br>

				"Is your copy of Skittish Autographed? Mine is"<br><br>
Thanks for the greeting, Drew. :) That really made my day. Oh well, our sibling rivalry will continue on until we die I suppose. Lately I feel quite short-changed by life. I don't feel like I've gotten the dues I deserved. And that's a scary thing to think because it can cause me to NOT live up to my potential by laying back and demanding what I believe I deserve. What I should be doing is going out and proving I'm worth something instead of waiting for someone to tell me. <br><br>
So, yeah, my brother's comment irked me. Why? Cuz I've supported Doughty from the beginning. But who the hell am I to wine about it? If I want Doughty's autograph why don't I get it tomorrow night when I go to the concert? Good point. And I'd like to thank Kristi Wade who turned me on to Doughty. <br><br>
P.S. Yes, I'm a crybaby.<br><br>
P.P.S. Yes, Clerks is a good movie.<br>

				Please, don't forget to pick up Tool's new album,Lateralus,
next Tuesday May 15. If you are curious what it may sound
like look for the first single off the new album called
"Schizm."<br><br>
Glenn Danzig is a god.<br><br><br>

				<hr size="2" noshade>
				Okay, last week was just a bad week. Granted, nothing has changed with the new week. But my outlook is a little brighter. I'm feeling more confident with my place in the world. I'm still struggling with the interest factor though. I just can't seem to find anything I'm very interested in lately. I can't really find any good music. Programming's lame. And Sysadmining is like banging my head against a wall for 3 hours. Reading. *sigh* Reading makes me fall asleep. <br><br>
I'll find something, I'm sure. <br>

				<hr size="2" noshade>
				I missed the Pinpal Burns boat. They sold out in one day in early April. I came too late to the party. Dammit. Well, I didn't need to drop the 30 bucks anyway. I've got better stuff to waste money/time on.<br><br>
Life in general has been moving at a snail's pace. Nothing really new and exciting has happened lately. And it's not like I'm not trying to make something happen. I had a review at work which I had a working assumption that I would be receiving a nice raise. That didn't happen. That was a bummer. I can't even work up the enthusiasm to cut my hair, to the dismay of Courtney. <br><br>
I did manage to pick up a new disc, Idlewild. I would suggest it to anyone who digs Brit rawk. I like it. I've read them being described as Scottish punk rawkers. I don't know if I'd consider their music punk but hey, maybe in Scotland they never had the Ramones.<br>

				<hr size="2" noshade>
				Okay, I swore off toys. I swear to god I did. No more toys. No more dropping a ton of money on things I look at. No more.<br><br>
Well, you know what? I am so damn close to having every Simpsons character toy. 20 bucks isn't going to hurt anything, right? <br><br>
But why do I need that ONE last character? It's Mayor Quimby. If I got him, I wouldn't have the entire collection. No. I'd be missing glow-in-the-dark Nuclear Homer and, even more depressing, PinPal Burns. These two figures were offered exclusively through ToyFare magazine. What makes PinPal Burns so annoying? Well, if you remember the episode where Burns insists on joining a bowling team there were 5 members. Moe, Homer, Apu, Otto, and Burns. Homer and Apu are already available. Moe and Otto are sure to follow suit. That would leave ONE of the group missing, Burns.The only way to get them was to send in a slip from the mag. Well, Nuclear Homer came out last year some time and Burns, well, the Toyfare mag he's in probably is gone. Right?<br><br>
<div align="center"><img src="/web/20010516222600im_/http://www.computerjargon.com/images/gallery/burns.jpg"></div>
BAM! There it is folks! The Toyfare mag certificate for PinPal Burns. I got one! WAHOO! Toy addiction here I come! <br><br>
P.S. A note for Courtney-- I cannot lay blame for this on anyone but me. The bug bit me. Sorry. Do we really need a honeymoon?

				Nothing against all the people I talk to but do me a favor. Go pick up a Social Distortion CD. Please. For the good of all humanity. Go get yourself a good musical background. For those of you who already love Social D please give me a call. I'd like to have a serious conversation with an intellegent person. <br>
